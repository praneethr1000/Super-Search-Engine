    "body": "No division was won by a greater margin last season than the American League Central, and its defending champions did their best to position themselves for another runaway on Tuesday.  Two wins away from a World Series berth in 2011, the Tigers have beefed up with Prince Fielder's bat and his $214 million, nine-year deal now in the fold.  The news certainly isn't positive for the Indians, White Sox, Royals and Twins -- Detroit's division-mates who finished second through fifth respectively -- but it also does not provide wholesale change from the dynamic the division carried a day earlier. Fielder's numbers in a larger body of work against Minnesota are more normal: a .261\/.344\/.514 line in 138 at-bats. Kansas City and Chicago, meanwhile, have actually done excellent jobs holding the slugger in check. Fielder's 1-for-12 (.083) against White Sox and 2-for-22 (.091) against the Royals lifetime. Not that any of it means much.           Evan Drellich is a reporter for MLB.com. Follow him on Twitter @EvanDrellich.
