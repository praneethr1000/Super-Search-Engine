    "body": "NEW YORK -- The Yankees acquired right-hander Chris Martin from the Rockies on Tuesday in exchange for cash considerations, the club announced. Martin, 28, had a 6.89 ERA in 16 appearances for Colorado last season, walking four and striking out 14 in 15 2\/3 innings. He generated a 60.8 percent ground-ball rate. The 6-foot-8, 215-pound hurler also made 25 appearances at Triple-A Colorado Springs, where he was 1-3 with five saves and a 4.39 ERA. Due to a shoulder injury, he did not pitch in the Minors until 2011, when he was 25. Martin was designated for assignment by the Rockies on Jan. 5. He has Minor League options remaining and is expected to compete for a bullpen spot in Spring Training. To make room on the 40-man roster for Martin, the Yankees designated right-hander Gonzalez Germen for assignment. Germen, 27, was purchased from the Mets on Dec. 19 in the first deal between the crosstown rivals since 2004. Bryan Hoch is a reporter for MLB.com.
