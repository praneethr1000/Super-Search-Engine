Werner, 35, will be entering his seventh season with the Brewers and his second under his current title. He's best known to fans as the Brewers' point man on salary-arbitration players, but Werner also works behind the scenes onÂ business affairs, with particular attention paid to construction projects and other enhancements to the Miller Park experience. Projects that have been completed under his guidance include the new scoreboard, the renovated team store and upgrades to Miller Park's club level and founder's suites.  \"Teddy has been a versatile and highly valued member of our front-office staff since he joined the organization in 2006,\" Brewers COO Rick Schlesinger said in a statement. \"His hard work and creativity have helped develop numerous projects and initiatives that have enhanced Miller Park for all fans. He is very deserving of this honor, and we are happy to have him here on our team.\" Adam McCalvy is a reporter for MLB.com. Read his blog, Brew Beat, and follow him on Twitter at @AdamMcCalvy.
