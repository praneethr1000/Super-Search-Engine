    "body": "NEW YORK -- The National Baseball Hall of Fame will announce whether there is an electee joining Ron Santo in the Class of 2012 on Monday. The results of the voting by eligible members of the Baseball Writers' Association of America will be revealed during an MLB.com simulcast of the announcement on MLB Network live at 2 p.m. ET.  The vote was conducted by the BBWAA this past December. Because of the least-imposing first-year group of eligible players in recent memory, former Reds shortstop Barry Larkin seems to be the lone possibility for election.  But he is no shoo-in. The 12-time National League All-Star and three-time Gold Glove Award winner, who played his entire 19-year career at home with Cincinnati, finished third in the 2011 balloting to second baseman Roberto Alomar and pitcher Bert Blyleven. The latter two were inducted into the Hall this past July 24, along with general manager Pat Gillick, a post-expansion Veterans Committee electee. Any new electee will be inducted into the Hall during this year's ceremonies on July 21-22 in Cooperstown, N.Y. Santo, the legendary Cubs third baseman, was elected to the Hall last month by the Golden Era Committee and will be inducted on July 22 behind the Clark Sports Center. On July 21 at Doubleday Field, Ford C. Frick Award winner Tim McCarver and J.G. Taylor Spink Award electee Bob Elliott will be honored in a separate ceremony.                        Barry M.
