    "body": "The Yankees acquired acquired left-hander Tyler Olson and infielder Ronald Torreyes in a Tuesday deal with the Dodgers, sending infielder Rob Segedin to Los Angeles. The two newcomers filled out the 40-man roster for the Yankees, who still owe a player to be named or cash considerations to the Dodgers to complete the transaction. â€¢ Hot Stove Tracker Olson, 26, had been designated for assignment last Wednesday by the Dodgers, who had acquired him in mid-December from Seattle, where in 2015 he had made his Major League debut. Olson went 1-1 in 11 relief appearances with the Mariners after posting a 4.47 ERA in 25 games, including six starts, with Triple-A Tacoma. Torreyes, primarily a middle infielder (511 of 612 Minor League games at shortstop or second base), appeared in eight games in '15 with the Dodgers. Otherwise, the 23-year-old Venezuelan was a vagabond last season, moving about the Double-A and Triple-A levels of three different organizations (Blue Jays, Astros, Dodgers). Segedin, a third-round pick in the 2010 Draft, batted .287 last season between Triple-A Scranton\/Wilkes-Barre and Double-A Trenton.
