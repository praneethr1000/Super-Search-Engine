    "body": "ARLINGTON -- The Rangers have agreed to terms with left-handed pitcher Jake Diekman on a one-year, $1.25 million contract for 2016 and avoided an arbitration hearing. First baseman Mitch Moreland is the Rangers' only arbitration-eligible player who remains unsigned. Diekman was acquired from the Phillies on July 31 in the same trade that brought Cole Hamels to Texas. Diekman had a 2.08 ERA and a .092 WHIP in 26 games for the Rangers. Diekman, a 30th-round pick by the Phillies in the 2007 Draft, has pitched in 217 games in the Major Leagues over the past four seasons, posting a 9-11 record with a 3.65 ERA. He will enter the 2016 season with Sam Freeman as the Rangers' two primary left-handed setup relievers. T.R. Sullivan is a reporter for MLB.com.
