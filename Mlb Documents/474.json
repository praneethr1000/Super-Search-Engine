Mariners manager Mike Hargrove and his wife, Sharon; former Mariners catcher Dan Wilson; and Seattle Mayor Greg Nickels joined over 40 volunteers in biting cold and rain to begin construction of a 1,400-square-foot house that will eventually become home to a needy local family.  Hargrove, who helped to frame and sheet the exterior walls of the two-story structure, enjoyed himself on the construction site, and marveled at the speed at which the pre-cut lumber and walls went up. Beginning Monday with the Mariners, Major League Baseball and 10 teams will build 12 homes that will benefit those affected by Hurricanes Katrina, Rita and Wilma.
