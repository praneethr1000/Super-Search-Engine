    "body": "MINOT, N.D. -- The first leg of the 52nd annual Twins Winter Caravan concluded on Thursday with a question-and-answer session at the Grand International Hotel, and all involved hailed the trip a major success.  Twins manager Ron Gardenhire, hitting coach Joe Vavra, radio broadcaster Cory Provus and left-handed pitchers Brian Duensing and Glen Perkins made the trip and came away impressed by what they saw.  Gardenhire, who has been going on the Winter Caravan since 1991, was proud to be a part of the trip, which went through the Upper Midwest and ended nearly 500 miles from Minneapolis in Minot. \"We're following in a long line going a long way back to guys like Harmon Killebrew and Tony Oliva, Rod Carew and players like that,\" Gardenhire said. \"So it's a big thing for our young people to understand how important it is to go out and do things like this. So it's what it's all about with our organization. It's about giving back to the community.\"   The caravan wrapped up on Thursday with a stop at the KDLR radio station in Devils Lake, N.D., before question-and-answer and autograph sessions at the Grand International Hotel.   It marked the final night stop of the Winter Caravan, which also featured Q-and-A and autograph sessions in cities such as Detroit Lakes, Minn.; Fargo, N.D.; and Grand Forks, N.D.   \"It went well,\" Duensing said. \"The last day of the leg was kind of long with a lot of driving, but other than that, we met a lot of fans and had great turnouts. They were all excited for baseball and it fires us up for the season.\"   The trip also had several visits to schools, including Holy Family School in Sauk Centre, Minn.; Minnewaska High School in Glenwood, Minn.; and Franklin Middle School in Thief River Falls, Minn.   The leg also included visits to places such as the Barrel O' Fun factory in Perham, Minn.; Giant Sunflower Seeds in Wahpeton, N.D.; and a classic car exhibit at the Shed in Warroad, Minn.   \"The Bob Marvin stop with the classic car show in Warroad was pretty awesome,\" Duensing said. \"But all the night stops were pretty fun. They were all big events and really stick out. But at th same time, all the school visits were fun to see the kids get excited, and not just for us, but for T.C. Bear. So it was nice seeing them ask questions about us and how we'll make changes next year.\"   Perkins, who grew up locally in Stillwater, Minn., also enjoyed the Winter Caravan, which was his fifth. He pointed to interacting with the fans as one of his favorite parts of the trip.   \"It's fun to get out and see fans and that,\" Perkins said. \"We've had some pretty good turnouts and cold weather so it's a typical caravan.\"   So while the Upper Midwest leg concluded, there are still plenty of stops next week, starting with a trip to the Treasure Island Resort and Casino in Red Wing, Minn., on Sunday that will be attended by Perkins, Drew Butera and broadcaster Dick Bremer.   Twins players -- including Ben Revere, Rene Tosoni, Anthony Swarzak, Trevor Plouffe, Chris Parmelee and Danny Valencia -- will also be on trips throughout Minnesota and South Dakota next week.   The week will also feature stops by players such as Joe Mauer and Denard Span as well as former players such as Bert Blyleven, Dan Gladden and Oliva. It officially concludes on Jan. 30 with the Old Timers Hot Stove banquet in Oakdale, Minn., with Gardenhire, Perkins and former manager Tom Kelly.  Rhett Bollinger is a reporter for MLB.com.
