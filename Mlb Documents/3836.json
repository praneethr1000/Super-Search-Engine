    "body": "According to a published report, the Angels are once again attempting to acquire slugging first baseman Paul Konerko from the Chicago White Sox.  The Los Angeles Daily News reported in its Saturday edition that new general manager Tony Reagins has been involved in talks with the White Sox for Konerko, who will be 32 this season and has averaged 36.75 homers over the past four seasons.  Among the names the White Sox reportedly have interest in are second baseman Howie Kendrick, third baseman Chone Figgins and pitcher Ervin Santana. All three would not be involved in a deal, with Chicago apparently seeking a package of two players. Of Konerko's 269 home runs in his nine seasons with the White Sox, 157 have been hit in Chicago -- more than 58 percent. When he hit 41 and 40 homers back to back in 2004 and 2005, 52 were hit at home, 29 on the road.     Lyle Spencer is a reporter for MLB.com.
