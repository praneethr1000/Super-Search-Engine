    "body": "Of all the worthy candidates on the 2006 ballot for the National Baseball Hall of Fame, the one candidate most deserving of election was Bruce Sutter.  So justice was once again served during this exercise in baseball democracy, when the Hall of Fame announced Tuesday that Sutter, in his 13th year on the ballot, had finally gained enough votes for induction.  This election, like every other balloting for induction to the Hall of Fame, left some other extremely deserving candidates on the doorstep, but still outside. Jim Rice, Goose Gossage, Andre Dawson and Bert Blyleven all received substantially more than 50 percent of the 520 votes cast by eligible members of the Baseball Writers' Association of America. But all fell short of the necessary 75 percent of the vote. What makes Sutter, out of all the stars on this ballot, particularly deserving of election? In his prime, there was simply nobody better. Part of this is objective. The numbers of his best seasons clearly reflect that notion. There is no question that Bruce Sutter was a pioneer of the closer's role and there is also no question that he was a pioneer of the split-fingered fastball that essentially revolutionized the way the game was pitched.
