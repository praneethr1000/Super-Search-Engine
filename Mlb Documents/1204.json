    "body": "CLEVELAND -- This is the season of hope for baseball fans. Spring Training is right around the corner, rosters are taking shape and each ballclub features some fresh faces and fresh starts.  There is always a level of optimism and excitement over the season to come, and that certainly seems to be the case right now in Cleveland. On Saturday, those feelings seemed to be spreading from the Indians' clubhouse and running throughout the lower level of Progressive Field, where fans were taking in this winter's Tribe Fest.  Judging by the solid turnout on the event's first day, the Indians' busy winter has caught their fans' attention. Jordan Bastian is a reporter for MLB.com.
