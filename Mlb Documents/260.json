    "body": "PHILADELPHIA -- Ryan Howard insists nothing has changed, except everything. A year ago, Howard could've slipped into a Winter Caravan stop unnoticed, or at least as hidden as a 6-foot-4, 260-pound human being can be. Sure, he fielded questions regarding his status as a player blocked by Jim Thome at first base, his potential experiment in left field or his perceived future in the Phillies organization, but Thome was still expected to be the man. A year later, following a season in which the powerful slugger helped the Phillies' playoff push -- capturing National League Rookie of the Year honors along the way -- Philadelphia showed him how much it thinks of Howard by dealing Thome to the White Sox in November.
