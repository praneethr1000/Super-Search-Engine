    "body": "The Red Sox reportedly agreed to a Minor League deal with outfielder Quintin Berry on Saturday that includes an invitation to Spring Training. The deal is believed to be worth $620,000 if Berry, now in his second stint with Boston, makes the Major League roster. In 2013, Berry played in 13 games for the Red Sox, mostly as a pinch-runner. He went 5-for-8 at the plate that season with a homer, five runs scored and three stolen bases. Berry also made the club's postseason roster that year and stole a base in all three of Boston's playoff series. He spent nearly all of 2014 playing at Triple-A Norfolk with the Orioles where he compiled a slash line of .285\/.382\/.367 and 25 stolen bases in 112 games. The Red Sox, however, already have an influx of outfielders on their 40-man roster expected to compete for spots out of Spring Training, so it is unclear where Berry, 30, fits into the team's future.
