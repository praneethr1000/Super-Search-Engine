    "body": "DENVER -- The Rockies settled one of their key offseason issues on Saturday by acquiring second baseman Marco Scutaro from the Red Sox for right-handed pitcher Clayton Mortensen.  Scutaro, 35, batted .299 with seven home runs, 54 RBIs and 59 runs scored last season while playing mostly at shortstop. With the Rockies he becomes the veteran second baseman to complement shortstop Troy Tulowitzki.  In 10 seasons, Scutaro has a career .270 batting average and .338 on-base percentage in 1,103 games with the Mets, Athletics, Blue Jays and Red Sox. Thomas Harding is a reporter for MLB.com.
