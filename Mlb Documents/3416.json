    "body": "CINCINNATI -- Outfielder Ryan Ludwick might have been born in Florida, attended high school and college in Las Vegas and resides in Texas, but he's got Cincinnati in his blood.  From his parents to his grandparents and various relatives and ancestors -- all were residents of the region, with many settled in nearby Georgetown, Ohio.  \"My family pretty much came off the boat and went to Cincinnati,\" Ludwick told MLB.com last month. \"Eric Davis was my favorite player growing up. The Reds were my favorite team.\" Mark Sheldon is a reporter for MLB.com. Read his blog, Mark My Word, and follow him on Twitter @m_sheldon.
