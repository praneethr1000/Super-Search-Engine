    "body": "A trio of the best young backstops in the game, including Joe Mauer of the Twins, Victor Martinez of the Indians and Michael Barrett of the Cubs, are back to build on their outstanding 2005 seasons. Those three could soon have company as other promising youngsters will get a chance to follow their path to Major League stardom. In Atlanta, the Braves will see if Brian McCann is ready to take over as the starting catcher. In Pittsburgh, the Pirates will try to figure out whether Humberto Cota or Ryan Doumit is ready to take charge as their starting catcher. Yadier Molina will try to continue the progress he made last year, his first as the starter in St. Louis, and in Seattle, Kenji Johjima will make his debut after a spectacular career in Japan.  Meanwhile, proven veteran receivers should ensure above-average production at the position for several teams. Those include the Mets, who added Paul Lo Duca, Cincinnati with Jason LaRue and Javier Valentin, Baltimore with Ramon Hernandez and Javy Lopez, the Red Sox with Jason Varitek, Philadelphia with Mike Lieberthal, the Yankees with Jorge Posada, the Giants with Mike Matheny, the Nationals with Brian Schneider and, of course, Detroit with Ivan Rodriguez.  Oakland (Jason Kendall), Houston (Brad Ausmus), Milwaukee (Damian Miller), Tampa Bay (Toby Hall) and the Chicago White Sox (A.J. Pierzynski) also have solid situations with veteran incumbents at the position.  The catching situation on a number of other teams is less optimistic, as questions regarding the position exist with the Angels, Marlins and Dodgers.  Two prominent free agent catchers, Bengie Molina and Mike Piazza, remain unsigned.  With Spring Training only four weeks away, MLB.com caught up with the catching situation for each of the 30 Major League teams.      Angels: Bengie Molina left the club this winter to pursue free agent dollars, though the two-time Gold Glove winner remains unsigned. Looking to take over behind the plate is brother Jose Molina with two highly-regarded prospects, Jeff Mathis and Mike Napoli, hoping to break through and win a job on the Opening Day roster.  Five more catchers will also be in Tempe on non-roster invitations when camp opens Feb. 15: Ryan Budde, Michael Collins, Brent Del Chiaro, Brett Martinez and Bobby Wilson.  There are no questions surrounding Jose Molina's abilities behind the plate. He led the AL by throwing out 49 percent of would-be basestealers last season and posted a .993 fielding percentage. In 2004, Jose Molina threw out potential basestealers at a 45 percent clip and led the league with five pickoffs while making just 56 starts. But his offensive skills are not nearly as developed and that may pose a problem for a lineup that will need production throughout the order in 2006. Jose Molina hit .228 last season with six homers to establish a career high, but slumped to .189 against right-handers.  Mathis has risen steadily through the Angels system. Selected in the first round of the 2001 draft, Mathis is well-regarded defensively but he's also shown some skills at the plate. In 112 games at Triple-A Salt Lake last season, Mathis hit .276 with 21 homers, 26 doubles and 73 RBIs. He was the only member of the team to be selected to the postseason Pacific Coast League All-Star team and was the organization's Minor League defensive player of the year.    Athletics: Kendall didn't have the type of year he or the A's had hoped for in 2005. A .306 career hitter who batted .325 and .319 in his previous two seasons, Kendall struggled through an inconsistent campaign that ended with him batting .271 -- the second-worst mark of his career. His league-high 101 stolen bases allowed set an Oakland record.  But Kendall rallied late in the year, batting .324 in September, providing hope for 2006.  Adam Melhuse has made great progress as a defensive catcher over the past few years. He takes a 66-game errorless streak into 2006 as Kendall's backup. He threw out three of 11 runners trying to steal against him last season. Kendall's 15.1-percent success rate against would-be thieves (18-for-119) was the second lowest in the Majors.    Blue Jays: Gregg Zaun was the starter, but when the Blue Jays signed Bengie Molina, things changed in a hurry.   The backup job seemed primed for Guillermo Quiroz. Then Toronto signed Jason Phillips to a Minor League deal on Jan. 3 that included an invitation to Spring Training with the big-league club. That could mean competition for Zaun and Quiroz, who has overcome multiple injuries from the last two seasons and has been in the organization since he was 17 years old.  Devil Rays: Hall will be back behind home plate for the Devil Rays in 2006 and veteran Josh Paul has joined the team to serve as a quality backup, giving the Devil Rays depth and quality at the position.  Hall, 29, started 122 games for the Rays in 2005 and had baseball's third-best percentage for throwing out baserunners (minimum 100 games) at a clip of 37.8 percent, which ranked just behind St. Louis' Yadier Molina (54.8 percent) and Detroit's Pudge Rodriguez (44.1 percent). Hall hit a career-high .287, raising his average 32 points from the previous season after getting a career-high 124 hits. If there is a criticism of Hall, it comes in the fact that 99 of those hits were singles and only three other regular catchers in the Major Leagues hit fewer home runs. But he did hit .321 with runners on base (61-190), tops on the Rays and second best among American League receivers behind Kendall (.322).  Paul spent the past two seasons with the Angels as the backup to Bengie Molina. He appeared in 34 games during the 2005 season and hit .189 with two home runs and four RBI. The Rays claimed Mike Rose off waivers from the Dodgers.    Orioles: Few teams in baseball are as strong behind the plate as the Orioles, who currently have two former All-Star backstops under contract. Hernandez is set to replace Lopez behind the plate this season, with Lopez moving to a hybrid role that should include plenty of playing time as designated hitter.  Due to injuries, both players caught fewer than 100 games last season. Before that, both had five-season streaks of at least 100 games behind the plate. Hernandez, who turns 30 in mid-May, will be making his return to the AL.    Indians: The Indians have one of the best catchers in the game in Victor Martinez. The presence of Martinez alone gives Cleveland one of the strongest catching situations in baseball.  Martinez is coming off a 2005 season in which he led all American League catchers in average (.305), RBIs (80), hits (167), runs (73) and doubles (33), and was tied for second in home runs (19). His .380 average in the second half of the season was the best in baseball.  Josh Bard returns to back up Martinez, and the Indians also brought former catcher Einar Diaz back into the organization last month.    Mariners: Japanese import Johjima takes over after signing a three-year, $16.5 million deal.  Johjima, 29, became the first catcher from Japan to sign with a Major League organization, and for good reason. He can hit, with a career batting average of .299 with 211 home runs and 699 RBIs in 11 seasons (1,117 games) with the Pacific League's Fukuoka Softbank Hawks. And he can play defense, too, with seven Japanese Gold Gloves to his credit. Scouts love Johjima's strong arm and surprisingly quick feet.  Rene Rivera, who showed promise at the plate in limited opportunities with the big club last year, will likely serve as backup. Last year's first-round draft selection, catcher Jeff Clement, will continue to learn as another top-notch prospect in the Minor Leagues.  Last year, the Mariners had seven different catchers, from the young (21-year-old Double-A callup Rivera), to the old (42-year-old veteran Pat Borders), to the Miguel O. crowd (Miguel Olivo, Miguel Ojeda), plus Yorvit Torrealba, Dan Wilson and Wiki Gonzalez. That crew was a combined 113-for-524 (.216) with 10 home runs and 46 RBIs.  Seattle's catching numbers should be much better in 2006.    Rangers: Rod Barajas and Gerald Laird gives the Rangers a strong duo to head their catching corps.  Barajas established career highs in every offensive category in 2005, including 120 games, 410 at-bats, 53 runs scored and 104 hits. Barajas also sported a career-high .254 average with 21 home runs and 60 RBIs. Only Boston's Jason Varitek hit more home runs as a catcher in 2005, hitting 22. Defensivley Barajas threw out 21 of 65 attempted basestealers, sixth among qualifying Major League catchers.  Laird hit .310 with 17 home runs and 55 RBIs for Triple-A Oklahoma in 2005. He missed a month with a strained left hamstring, but showed he was completely recovered from the torn thumb ligament injury that opened the door for Barajas to move into, and eventually win, the starter's role during the 2004 campaign.    Red Sox: The biggest change in Boston is Varitek won't have his longtime backup, Doug Mirabelli, around in 2006.  Veteran John Flaherty, who broke into the Major Leagues with Boston (1992-93) will take over the role. Flaherty might be a shade behind Mirabelli offensively, but Flaherty is clearly better defensively. Between Flaherty and Varitek, the Red Sox should be solid behind the plate this season.    Royals: The Royals continue to be confident that John Buck will be their catcher for a long time.  Last season, Buck played 118 games and batted .242. The tall, slender right-handed hitter had just 12 home runs and 47 RBIs, which were disappointing numbers. In each of his two years with Kansas City, he's finished strong offensively. Last year he hit safely in 17 of his last 19 starts for a .356 average (26-for-73), four homers and 15 RBIs. That boosted his average from .216 to .242. But it's long-term consistency that has eluded him so far. Defensively, however, Buck has been as good as expected.  This year Buck will further benefit in that he's paired with veteran Paul Bako, who was signed as a free agent. Another plus is that Bako is a left-handed hitter, which gives manager Buddy Bell the luxury of doing some platooning with the right-handed Buck.    Tigers: Rodriguez finished 2005 with his lowest batting average since 1993, lowest RBI total since 1992 and lowest on-base percentage since he was a 19-year-old rookie in 1991.  This year Rodriguez will try to put a forgettable 2005 season behind him with a new start for a new manager, Jim Leyland.  Defensively, Rodriguez is still among the best. He led the league by throwing out 44.1 percent (26-for-59) of would-be basestealers and picking off six other runners.    Twins: A fully healthy Mauer, along with a competent backup in Mike Redmond, makes the Twins one of the league's most well-stocked teams at the catching position.  The 22-year-old had a better year in 2005 than in his rookie season. After being limited to only 35 games in 2004 due to a torn meniscus in his left knee, Mauer emerged to hit .294 over 131 games. He batted in 55 runs and hit nine homers in his first full season of activity in the Majors.  Redmond saw action in 45 games while hitting .311 with 26 RBIs and one home run.  There are two other catchers on Minnesota's 40-man roster, Chris Heintz and Rob Bowen. Heintz was a September callup last year and even made a start for the club when Mauer was injured. The 31-year-old has toiled through the Minors for 10 years and though he isn't expected to push for a spot on the 25-man roster, he could be available if injuries plague either Mauer or Redmond.    White Sox: Pierzynski and Chris Widger give the White Sox a top tandem again this season.  Pierzynski exhibited the sort of intangible leadership and even a little bit of attitude as the White Sox won the World Series. The payoff for Pierzynski was a three-year, $15-million deal he received during the offseason.  Once again Pierzynski and Widger's primary role will be carefully handling one of the best pitching staffs in all of baseball. But both came up big offensively often enough last season to prove their value.    Yankees: Posada returns for a ninth season as the Yankees' starting catcher, though it is unclear just how many years the veteran has left in that role.  His .262 average last season ranked sixth among AL catchers, while his 19 homers placed third. He did have more RBIs than all but one other AL backstop, as Cleveland's Victor Martinez drove in 80 to Posada's 71.  Defensively, Posada's .996 fielding percentage trailed only Pierzynski, tying him for second in the AL. However, he threw out just 30 percent of would-be basestealers, sixth best in the league, as he allowed 90 stolen bases in 129 attempts. Only Martinez and Kendall allowed more.  Flaherty's three-year run as Posada's backup is over, as the Yankees signed Kelly Stinnett in November to fill that role. Stinnett signed a one-year, $650,000 deal, becoming the eighth backup catcher on the club since 2000.  Should either catcher land on the disabled list, Wil Nieves will be waiting in the wings at Triple-A Columbus to lend a helping hand. Nieves, 28, hit .289 with four homers and 37 RBIs in 102 games with the Clippers in 2005. He was called up to the Majors in September, appearing in three games with the Yankees.  NATIONAL LEAGUE   Astros: Ausmus was re-signed for another two years, ensuring his Houston tenure will last through 2007.  Ausmus had some leverage during contract negotiations, due in large part to his offense in the second half of the 2005 season. Never known as much of a contributor at the plate, Ausmus hit close to .300 in the second half of the season during the Astros' improbable Wild Card finish.  Two candidates to serve as Ausmus' backup will be scrutinized this spring: Raul Chavez and Humberto Quintero. Chavez signed a one-year deal worth $400,000, but he will be challenged by Quintero, a younger option with a terrific arm and improving bat.  Waiting in the wings is Hector Gimenez, who hit .273 with 12 homers and 58 RBIs in his second season at Double-A Corpus Christi in 2005.    Braves: Coming off a memorable rookie season that was highlighted by the three-run homer he hit off Roger Clemens, McCann gives the Braves confidence that they have a chance to be really strong at catcher for many years to come.  They'll enter this season with McCann as their starting catcher and Todd Pratt ready to provide his veteran leadership in a backup role. Jarrod Saltalamacchia, the club's top selection in the 2003 draft, may be just a year away from making his arrival in Atlanta.    Brewers: Miller and Chad Moeller will return in 2006 for a second season together. Primary catching duties are expected to again go to Miller, a 36-year-old Wisconsin native who is entering the second season of a three-year contract and will earn $3.25 million.  In his first year with the Brewers, Miller batted .273 with nine home runs and 43 RBIs while leading National League catchers with 50 runs scored. He caught 917 1\/3 innings to Moeller's 520 2\/3 and Miller ranked third among NL catchers with a .996 fielding percentage.  For insurance, the Brewers signed catchers Mike Rivera and Mark Johnson and utility man Vinny Rottino to Minor League contracts with Spring Training invitations. All three could start the year at Triple-A Nashville, with Rottino serving as a super-utility player (he once played all nine positions in one game for Class A Beloit).    Cubs: Barrett won the Silver Slugger Award in 2005 after batting .276 with 16 homers, 32 doubles and 61 RBIs. He posted the second-highest home run total by an NL catcher, trailing Piazza, who hit 19.  Barrett played in 133 games and Henry Blanco in 54, primarily matching up with Mark Prior. Blanco is the better defensive catcher. He threw out nearly 49 percent of basestealers (19 of 39) and his catcher's ERA was 3.58, second-lowest of his career. But he hit .242 (.158 in the first half, .318 in the second).  Geovany Soto, who spent the final month of the regular season with the big-league club, is third on the depth chart.    Cardinals: Yadier Molina is back after a solid 2005 season. Molina, handed the job when Matheny left via free agency, played brilliant defense and showed offensive development after a slow start.  The greatest issue with Cardinals catching in 2005 was the backup job. Einar Diaz never earned the full trust of the team's coaching staff or pitchers, which meant that Molina had to carry a heavy workload until he landed on the disabled list with a broken bone in his hand. Mike Mahoney stepped in and played fine defensively, but his offense simply wasn't acceptable even for a backup catcher.  Veteran Gary Bennett was signed and while Bennett may not outhit Diaz, he should work well with the pitchers.  Michel Hernandez, a 27-year-old native of Cuba, put up a .367 on-base percentage at Triple-A Columbus (Yankees organization) in 2003, and .368 at San Diego's Portland affiliate in 2005. Hernandez will likely head to Triple-A Memphis, where he would be the reserve option if either Bennett or Molina were injured.    Diamondbacks: The Diamondbacks bolstered the catching corps at the Winter Meetings in December when they acquired Johnny Estrada from the Braves in exchange for pitchers Lance Cormier and Oscar Villarreal.  Estrada was limited to 105 games last season, missing some time after being involved in a collision at home plate with the Angels' Darin Erstad on June 6. But he's regarded as a good offensive catcher, as evidenced by his performance in 2004, when he hit .314 with 36 doubles, nine homers and 76 RBIs and appeared in the All-Star Game.  Koyie Hill, the starter coming out of Spring Training last season, is still in the picture. The addition of Estrada buys time for highly-regarded youngster Miguel Montero to continue to develop. Montero started the 2005 season at Class A Lancaster before being promoted to Double-A Tennessee.    Dodgers: The Dodgers were able to upgrade at a number of positions, but catcher wasn't one of them.  Topping the depth chart for now is Dioner Navarro, who will be 22 in February. Navarro began last season at Triple-A Las Vegas, overcame a nagging hand injury, then got hot enough in July to make the Triple-A All-Star Game. He was promoted and given Jason Phillips' starting catcher job for the final two months of the season, when he hit .273 with three homers and 14 RBIs. A switch-hitter, Navarro batted .435 in 23 right-handed at-bats. The Venezuela native threw out eight of 41 potential basestealers, slightly better than the rate that got Phillips benched, but well off the 31 percent Navarro erased in Las Vegas.  Veteran Sandy Alomar Jr. was signed to help out and the Dodgers also have in their system Russell Martin, considered by some in the organization to have a higher ceiling than Navarro. Martin, one year older than Navarro with one fewer year of professional experience, played at Double-A Jacksonville last year and hit .311 with nine homers, 61 RBIs, 83 runs and nine more walks than strikeouts, leading to a .430 on-base percentage. Originally a third baseman, the native Canadian switched positions in 2003.    Giants: Matheny had a career-high 13 homers and 59 RBIs last season, hit .311 with runners on base, posted the highest single-season fielding percentage for a San Francisco catcher, with one error in 862 chances, and led all big-league catchers with 34 doubles.  Matheny is back, but he'll have a new backup as longtime No. 2 Torrealba has moved on. Who will back up Matheny will be determined in Spring Training.  Yamid Haad, who saw time at backup last season, is now back in the Minor Leagues and trailing Justin Knoedler and Eliezer Alfonzo as contenders for the Giants' reserve role. Also in the mix is Todd Jennings, 24, a non-roster spring invitee who also played extensively in the infield last year with Class A San Jose, establishing career highs in every category except average and triples. He hit .288 with 22 doubles, 10 home runs and 67 RBIs.  Knoedler, 25, played in only eight games for San Francisco last year, managing to collect his first Major League hit, a pinch-hit single. For Triple-A Fresno, the backstop batted .272 with four homers and 32 RBIs. The 27-year-old Alfonzo hit .313 in 49 games for Double-A Connecticut before a brief stint with Fresno.    Marlins: Olivo, Josh Willingham and Matt Treanor are the candidates to succeed LoDuca as the Marlins starter now that Lo Duca has been dealt to the Mets.  Olivo is the most experienced of the three with more than 300 Major League games, mostly with the White Sox. Willingham is a converted third baseman who also has played some left field. But at the Minor League levels, he has shown power, batting .324 with 19 homers and 54 RBIs in 66 games with Triple-A Albuquerque last season. At Double-A Carolina in 2004, he belted 24 home runs with 76 RBIs along with a .281 average in 112 games.    Mets: The Mets should be better offensively and defensively now that LoDuca has joined Ramon Castro to handling the Mets' catching in 2006.  Mets manager Willie Randolph hasn't made permanent plans for his catchers, but it is likely Castro will start more than one-fifth of the games.  Lo Duca battted.283 in 445 at-bats and a point lower in 131 at-bats with runners in scoring position last season. Castro, who turns 30 March, appeared in 99 games -- 57 starts -- and drove in 41 runs in 209 at-bats in 2005.    Nationals: For the third year in a row, the Nationals franchise enters Spring Training with defensive whiz Brian Schneider as its starter. Once again, however, the backup situation behind Schneider is anything but clear.  Schneider has become one of baseball's top defensive catchers. He was one of the league leaders by throwing out 29 of 77 possible basestealers (37.7 percent). He topped all Major League catchers in the same category in 2003 and 2004. The Nationals signed catchers Wiki Gonzalez, Mike DiFelice, Alberto Castillo and Brandon Harper to Minor League contracts. One of those will have to win the backup job during Spring Training.  Gonzalez played 14 games for the Mariners last season and hit .267 with two RBIs. DiFelice has played 10 years in the big leagues and is best known for his years with the Cardinals. He played briefly for the Mets in 2005 and went 2-for-17 (.111) in 11 games. Last season, Castillo batted .208 with 14 RBIs in 35 games for Kansas City and Oakland sandwiched around a stint with Triple-A Sacramento.  Harper was Florida's fourth-round selection in the 1997 First-Year Player Draft. Last season, he hit .246 with six home runs and 34 RBIs in 81 games for Triple-A Toledo.  If all else fails, the Nationals could move Robert Fick from outfield\/first base to No. 2 catcher.    Padres: A position that was a strength last season thanks to the combined efforts of Hernandez, Olivo and Fick will be in new hands in 2006. Penciled in to replace Hernandez, Olivo and Fick are Mirabelli, David Ross, Pete Laforest and Todd Greene.  Mirabelli, acquired at the Winter Meetings from Boston in a controversial swap for second baseman Mark Loretta, apparently goes to Spring Training as the No. 1 guy -- something new for the 35-year-old career backup. Barring another move, Ross, Laforest and Greene are expected to compete for the No. 2 role.    Phillies: The Lieberthal era enters its 10th and possibly final season in 2006, as the veteran backstop continues his long run of Opening Day starts. No catcher currently in the Major Leagues has started more season openers for the same team than Lieberthal.  At 34, Lieberthal is starting to show wear. Though he avoided the disabled list, he totaled his fewest games (118) and at-bats (392) since 2001 -- when he tore up his knee diving back to first base on a pickoff attempt.  With Pratt departed for Atlanta, the Phillies brought in journeyman Sal Fasano, who rejoined the Major League ranks in 2005 for the first time since 2002. Fasano, 34, found his way into 64 games last season for the Orioles and clubbed 11 homers.    Pirates: With the rest of the starting lineup all but set for 2006, the competition between Cota and Doumit could be among the most intriguing storylines to follow during Spring Training.  Cota, 26, who had been used only sparingly as Kendall's understudy in 2004, took a .252 batting average with six home runs and 27 RBIs in 163 at-bats into the All-Star break. However, his production tailed off as he wore down in the second half, and he closed out the season by batting just .231 with one home run in his final 134 trips to the plate.  Doumit, 24, began the season by strong at Triple-A Indianapolis, where he was batting .345 with 12 home runs and 35 RBIs at the time of his June 5 promotion to the big leagues. After hitting just .178 during his first two months with Pittsburgh, Doumit began to heat up in the dog days of August. Over the final nine weeks of the season, he batted at a .311 clip with four home runs and 21 RBIs.  While the Pirates would probably prefer to have Doumit step up and take the everyday catching position this spring because of his higher offensive ceiling, general manager Dave Littlefield has said that both players will be given an equal opportunity to prove that they deserve the job.    Reds: LaRue and Valentin are back after combining to connect for 26 homers while catching, which tied them for the Major League lead among backstop combos in 2005. Their 101 RBIs were tops in the league.  All Reds manager Jerry Narron has to do is continue figuring when the best is time to start each catcher. Last year, LaRue started 104 games of his 110 games played behind the plate. Valentin played 76 games, with 58 starts as catcher.  Both players' personal statistics certainly thrived under the 2005 setup. LaRue, who turns 32 in March, established career highs in average (.260), doubles (27) and RBIs (60) while hitting 14 home runs. Valentin's .281 average, 14 homers and 36 runs scored all were career bests.  Beyond those two, Dane Sardinha will have a chance to win a spot on the 25-man roster with a solid Spring Training. Sardinha, a 2000 second-round draft pick, spent the past two seasons at Triple-A Louisville. Miguel Perez, 22, made the sizeable leap from high Class A Sarasota to the Majors last season and is considered a future prospect.    Rockies: Danny Ardoin will vie for playing time with Torrealba, who was obtained in a December trade with Seattle for pitcher Marcos Carvajal. Torrealba's career in San Francisco, where he played until being sent to the Mariners late last season, was dogged by the Giants' acquisitions of more-established backstops Santiago and Matheny.  Torrealba, 27, who has been playing in winter playoffs in Venezuela, has batted .250 in 713 Major League at-bats over five-plus seasons. He also is strong against the running game.  The Rockies claimed Ojeda off waivers from Seattle. Although he's in camp under a Minor League contract, Ojeda, who turns 31 on Jan. 25, has experience in the NL West with San Diego. The wild card could be Eli Marrero, a utility player who signed a non-roster deal with the Rockies. Jim Molony is a writer for MLB.com.
