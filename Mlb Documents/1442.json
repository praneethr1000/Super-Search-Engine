    "body": "DENVER -- The Rockies have looked to an old friend to help with their new pitching plan. Right-hander Manny Corpas, the closer on the 2007 Rockies club that went to the only World Series in team history, rejoined the Rockies on Wednesday, agreeing to a Minor League contract with an invitation to Major League Spring Training, according to Major League sources. With Corpas two seasons removed from the elbow surgery he underwent at the end of the 2010 season, the Rockies believe he can fill a hybrid relief role. Corpas, 30, who earned 19 saves in the regular season and five in the postseason after taking over as closer during the 2007 campaign, was with the Rockies from 2006-10, with the final years affected by elbow problems. After sitting out the 2011 season, Corpas made 48 appearances for the Cubs last season and went 0-2 with a 5.01 ERA. Corpas became a free agent when he refused outright assignment to the Minors after the season. Thomas Harding is a reporter for MLB.com.
