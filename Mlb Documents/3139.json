    "body": "PHILADELPHIA -- It was the perfect synergy between baseball and hockey on Saturday at Citizens Bank Park. While the alumni of the Rangers and Flyers were fighting it out on a makeshift ice surface below, up in the press box etched in black marker on a white board remained the lineups from Game 5 of the recent National League Division Series between the hometown Phillies and Cardinals.  \"It's a tradition here to leave the lineups up until we play the next game,\" said Ed Deal, a longtime pressbox attendant at Phillies games.  It's also a painful reminder to local fans that the Phillies lost and the Cardinals went on to win the World Series, that the unexpected can happen. It's also a reminder that the lineups will change. The No. 3 hitter for the Cardinals, one Albert Pujols, is now an Angel. The Phillies' No. 6 hitter, Raul Ibanez, is probably gone. Time marches on. Barry M.
