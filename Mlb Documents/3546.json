    "body": "Left-hander Danny Hultzen, the No. 2 overall pick in the 2011 First-Year Player Draft, signed too late to make his Minor League debut for the Mariners last summer.  However, the club got a chance to see what Hultzen is capable of doing during the Arizona Fall League. Hultzen, pitching for the Peoria Javelinas, started six games and went 1-0 with a 1.40 ERA that was the second-lowest in the league. In 19 1\/3 innings, he struck out 18, walked five and allowed 16 hits. He struck out 16 in his final 10 1\/3 innings.  \"The Arizona Fall League was an incredible experience,\" Hultzen said. \"It gave me a taste of what to expect in a regular professional season, playing against some of the best in the world. It gave me a lot of confidence that I can do this.\" Hultzen is a rookie in every sense of the word, but he is on the 40-man roster and will be in big league camp competing for a job. The Mariners have signed veteran starters Kevin Millwood and Oliver Perez to Minor League contracts that could keep them from pushing pitchers like Hultzen and Paxton. But Hultzen will get a good look in Peoria, Ariz.       T.R. Sullivan is a reporter for MLB.com. Read his blog, Postcards from Elysian Fields, and follow him on Twitter @Sullivan_Ranger.
