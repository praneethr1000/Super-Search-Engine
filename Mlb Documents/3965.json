    "body": "CHICAGO -- Almost 19 months removed from surgery to re-attach his lat muscle, Jake Peavy seems more than ready to test what he has left in his right arm.  \"We are going to find out, that's the bottom line,\" said Peavy, who finished 7-7 with a 4.92 ERA in 2011. \"There's no doubt that they told me 12 to 18 months out of surgery you are as good as you are going to get.  \"I've done all the rehab. We've done all the work. You know, who I am is who I am, and hopefully it's a tick better and it's that guy we saw flashes of at times last year.\" Peavy had a normal offseason for the first time in three years, not having to worry about any sort of rehab work. He put a gym in his Alabama home and has been able to build normally for the start of Spring Training and the regular season.   \"I'm feeling good. I'm as healthy as I can feel,\" said Peavy, who is in the last year of his three-year, $52 million deal, although the White Sox have a $22-million club option for 2013 or a $4-million buyout. \"It has been nice to have a winter to just get prepared the way you have always prepared. I've only had a few winters where something has been nagging.   \"But the last winter and the winter previous were all about rehabbing and trying to get healthy. I'm excited and feel like I still have a lot left in the tank. I still feel young. I'm excited to get started.\"",
