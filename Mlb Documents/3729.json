    "body": "The countdowns are over, the ball has hit the ground and just like that, 2011 is here. Still on the agenda for the Mets? Signing a starting pitcher and a reliever. First on the agenda for Mets.com? Answering some Inbox questions. So without further ado: With \"up-and-coming\" starters Mike Pelfrey and Jon Niese having stretches of dominance followed by stretches of cluelessness, what is so special about pitching coach Dan Warthen that he made the cut? -- Jim R., Richmond, Mass. Let's not forget that despite their myriad struggles and injuries last season, the Mets still managed to rank seventh in baseball with a 3.70 ERA. Attribute some of that to R.A. Dickey, who came out of nowhere to become a rock for the staff. But credit most of it to Pelfrey and Niese who, despite their aforementioned periods of struggle, both took significant steps forward in 2010. Though Pelfrey did follow up his torrid start with a poor month of July, Warthen helped boost him out of that funk to finish 5-3 with a 2.78 ERA over his final 11 starts. It would hardly be fair, also, to pin Niese's late-season struggles on his pitching coach. It was manager Jerry Manuel's decision -- not Warthen's -- to continue trotting a clearly-fatigued Niese out to the mound every five days. Plus, even taking those periods of struggles into account, both Pelfrey and Niese still easily outperformed their preseason expectations. So praise Warthen for the gains of those two, along with the major contributions that the Mets received from scrap-heap relievers such as Elmer Dessens and Raul Valdes. Statistically speaking, Warthen did nothing in 2010 to warrant a dismissal.  Nor are those the only reasons he is one of two holdovers from Manuel's coaching staff. Warthen, known for his forthcoming style and sense of humor, is also a clear favorite amongst the team's pitchers. I asked Pelfrey about Warthen last month, and here's what he had to say:  \"I thought it was very, very important for him to come back. For the most part, the pitching staff did a good job last year. We improved on the walks, especially early in the year. We had a good ERA. We're going to have some young guys, so it's going to be important because Dan's a good communicator. It will be nice for those guys to have a pitching coach who communicates the way Dan Warthen does. That will help them a lot.\"  What can you tell us about the Mets' new batting instructor? Last season, the Mets seemed to be trying to pull everything, and I believe this is why they hit so poorly with runners in scoring position. The only exception was young Josh Thole. Shouldn't they be trying to use all parts of an extra-large park like Citi Field? -- Mickey D., St. Petersburg, Fla.  Though there are merits to that opposite-field philosophy, the Mets are wary of taking it to an extreme. Two years ago, the team placed heavy emphasis on going the other way in Spring Training, which some within the organization believe led to poor offensive seasons for several players -- most notably David Wright. Though Wright is indeed at his best when he's driving the ball to right-center field, trying too hard to do so can also be detrimental. Realizing that, the Mets, collectively, swung more normally in 2010. What you saw was a correction, not an aberration.  After two seasons, it may be clear that Citi Field is a pitchers' park. But it's not impossible to pull a ball out of Citi from either side of the plate -- just ask Mark Reynolds or Adam Dunn.  As for new hitting coach Dave Hudgens, it's too early to tell what sort of specific philosophy he'll impart upon the Mets outside of his stated -- and rather general -- goal of improving the team's on-base percentage. The last time Hudgens led a Major League offense back in 2003, his A's ranked ninth in the big leagues with 4.77 runs per game. The Mets might have made the playoffs last season with that sort of production.      Recently, I read that the Mets liked a certain starting pitcher because he could strike out people. Why would the Mets want a starting pitcher who, as a strikeout pitcher, throws more pitches and does not put the ball in play in spacious Citi Field? Wouldn't a pitcher who throws ground balls and fly balls and throws fewer pitches be an ideal candidate for the big ballpark? -- Ken M., Tucson, Ariz.  The fences at Citi may be deeper, but the gaps are larger, too. Strikeouts are always a better option than putouts, anyway, for the simple reason that they take defense out of the equation. It's one less thing that can go wrong. Given his druthers, Sandy Alderson has said he'd always prefer a strikeout pitcher to a contact pitcher -- as long as the strikeout machine is also capable of limiting walks.  In my eyes, the Mets just passed up on a great opportunity. I'm no GM, but when George Sherrill signs for the same amount of money as D.J. Carrasco, why couldn't Alderson sign both or even just Sherrill? He could get out all those tough Phillies lefties. Am I wrong? -- Norm B., Queens, N.Y.  Had the Mets desired, they surely could have upped Atlanta's offer and signed Sherrill to replace the departed Pedro Feliciano in the bullpen. But why sign a Sherrill to a one-year contract when the team doesn't figure to compete for a division title this season? And why ink a soon-to-be-34-year-old reliever -- one who posted a 6.69 ERA last season, mind you -- to a multiyear deal? Had the Mets wanted to do that, they could have simply re-signed Feliciano.  Carrasco's two-year deal is completely different. He's versatile enough that he can help out in the rotation -- as well as the bullpen -- if the Mets need him to. And his track record of consistency gives the Mets reason to believe he can still help them out in 2012, after they presumably add some significant pieces to the roster. Sherrill would have provided no such promise.  Why do the Mets keep passing up Orlando Hudson in free agency when he has filled a need every year he has become available? He's always come with a low price tag and turns out to be a better option at second base than we have\/had. -- Sean W., West Haverstraw, N.Y.  In years past, Hudson might have indeed been an ideal option for the Mets at second -- he could been the difference between making the postseason and missing it in 2008. But now 33 years old, Hudson has not posted an OPS higher than .774 in either of the past two seasons. Last summer, he struck out more frequently than he has in years. And while the average salary amongst big league second basemen rose to $4.8 million last year, Hudson made $5 million and will average significantly more than that over the next three seasons in San Diego -- a questionable investment considering his anticipated decline due to age. Once again, it's a risk the Mets felt they were better off not taking.  When press and fans talk about second base, it's as if Justin Turner doesn't exist. Doesn't he? -- Bob G., White Plains, N.Y.  Well sure, Bob, he's on the 40-man roster and will be in Spring Training competing for a job along with everyone else. Turner's main problem is he doesn't project to hit with enough power or consistency to warrant an everyday job on a Major League team. If he surprises everyone in Spring Training while Daniel Murphy, Luis Castillo and Brad Emaus disappoint, he could earn a crack at the starting gig. But most likely, he'll compete with Emaus, Chin-lung Hu and Luis Hernandez for a bench spot. Working against Turner is the fact that he still has Minor League options, meaning the Mets can send him back to the farm without risking losing him.  What is the latest news about Steven Matz? -- John K., Augusta, Maine  Matz, the team's first-round Draft pick in 2009, underwent Tommy John surgery last May and is out for most, if not all, of this season. Expect him to return at full strength in Spring Training 2012 or, if he recovers quickly, perhaps even the tail end of '11. Losing a year of development is never beneficial for a young pitcher, but the Mets can take solace in the fact that Matz won't turn 20 until May, and that a single Tommy John surgery no longer represents much of a risk even to extremely young pitchers.
