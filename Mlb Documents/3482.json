    "body": "MILWAUKEE -- Brewers outfielder Ryan Braun will break his uncharacteristically long silence in a short speech after accepting his National League MVP Award at a banquet in New York on Saturday, the New York Times reported Wednesday.  Other than some brief text messages with outlets including MLB.com, Braun has not spoken publicly since ESPN broke the news in mid-December that he faced a suspension under Major League Baseball's Joint Drug Prevention and Treatment Program. Braun is appealing the test, which according to the report registered a high level of testosterone.  Braun told MLB.com in December, \"I would love to talk, but unfortunately I'm not really allowed to say anything right now. My day will come soon, though.\" Adam McCalvy is a reporter for MLB.com.
