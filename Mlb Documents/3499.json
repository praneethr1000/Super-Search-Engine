    "body": "BOSTON -- David Ortiz arrived at the annual dinner for the Boston chapter of the Baseball Writers' Association of America not knowing how much money he will make in 2012, but with the knowledge that he'll be back for a 10th season of driving in runs for the Red Sox.  \"[Heck] yeah, another year that you come in and do your thing, like usual,\" Ortiz said on Thursday night.  But it's a bit unusual for Ortiz in that he accepted Boston's offer for arbitration instead of keeping his free-agent rights, and the designated hitter might actually go to a hearing with the team he's played for since 2003. However, Ortiz is taking the situation in stride, and he is comfortable that agent Fern Cuza will put him in a good situation.   \"That's part of the game,\" Ortiz said. \"From the business standpoint, that's how it goes. I don't know [how it will turn out]. I'm watching from the outside.\"   The Red Sox submitted an arbitration figure of $12.65 million. Ortiz countered at $16.5 million.   Earlier this winter, the sides discussed a two-year deal driven by the motivation of keeping Ortiz in Boston the rest of his career. Is that still possible?   \"It doesn't seem like it right now,\" said Ortiz. \"I decided to go through arbitration, and your agent and the team, they take care of the rest of it.\"   The Red Sox are just happy to know Ortiz will be wearing their uniform for at least one more year.   \"The best DH in the game, that guy's back on the team,\" said Red Sox general manager Ben Cherington.
