    "body": "MIAMI -- With the future of the organization up in the air, the Marlins are absolutely certain about one thing: They envision Dontrelle Willis being the anchor of the franchise.  On Monday afternoon, the Marlins agreed to terms with Willis on a one-year, $4.35 million deal that can reach $4.55 million with incentives.  The signing avoided the Marlins exchanging numbers with Willis' agent, Matt Sosnick, and is the richest contract in Major League history for a first-year arbitration-eligible starting pitcher. The previous high for a starter was $3.8 million, shared by pitchers Roy Halladay and Andy Pettitte, while Yankees shortstop Derek Jeter and Dodgers closer Eric Gagne both made $5 million in their first year of arbitration eligibility. Willis, 24, is a two-time All-Star and was the 2005 National League Cy Young Award runner-up to St. Louis' Chris Carpenter.   In a remarkable third season, Willis paced the Major Leagues in wins, posting a 22-10 record and a 2.63 ERA, making 34 starts while logging 236 1\/3 innings.   The D-Train led the Majors with five shutouts and posted seven complete games.   Locking up Willis to a one-year deal starts off the new year on a positive for the Marlins, an organization that is exploring relocation because no firm stadium deal is in place to keep the team in South Florida.   It's been a hectic offseason for the Marlins, who have dramatically reduced payroll by trading away a number of their marquee players, including Carlos Delgado, Josh Beckett, Mike Lowell, Paul Lo Duca and Juan Pierre.   Willis is not eligible for free agency until after the 2009 season, but indications are Florida is looking to retain the left-hander for the foreseeable future.   From the outset, Marlins general manager Larry Beinfest had told Sosnick the team planned on being fair to Willis in contract talks.   \"Larry Beinfest said he would treat Dontrelle with respect and that he would be compensated fairly on how he pitched [in 2005],\" Sosnick said. \"I believe he kept his word. Larry did what he said he would do.\"      Through the contract talks, Sosnick got the sense the Marlins see Willis on their team for years to come. But until a new stadium deal is finalized, either in South Florida or elsewhere, there is a reluctance by the team and players to make long-term commitments at this point.   Since Willis is just entering the arbitration process, the organization and Sosnick were agreeable to signing for just one year.   A resident of Alameda, Calif., Willis spends much of his offseason in South Florida.   \"He's very comfortable there,\" Sosnick said. \"I just think he's not going anywhere [anytime soon].\"   Called up from Double-A in early May 2003, Willis was the NL Rookie of the Year that season, and he played a huge role in the Marlins winning the World Series.   In his still relatively young Major League career, Willis has a 46-27 career record with a 3.27 ERA. He is three victories shy of matching A.J. Burnett's mark for most wins by a pitcher in Marlins history. Joe Frisaro is a reporter for MLB.com. This story was not subject to the approval of Major League Baseball or its clubs.",
