    "body": "TORONTO -- The Blue Jays signed veteran infielder Omar Vizquel to a Minor League contract with an invitation to Spring Training on Monday night.  Vizquel appeared in 58 games with the White Sox this past season, and he hit .251 with seven doubles, a triple, no home runs and eight RBIs.  The 44-year-old defensive specialist is expected to compete with Mike McCoy and Luis Valbuena for Toronto's utility infielder spot when camp opens in late February. Vizquel has appeared in 2,908 games during a 23-year career that included time with Seattle, San Francisco, Texas, Cleveland and the White Sox. He is just 159 hits shy of 3,000 and has a chance to improve on that number with the Blue Jays.   The native of Venezuela is the all-time leader in games played at shortstop and is known more for his work in the field than his abilities at the plate. Vizquel has won 11 Gold Gloves and at one point was infielder John McDonald's mentor with the Indians.   Vizquel is a career .272 hitter with 80 home runs and 944 RBIs, and he ranks first on the all-time list for hits by a Venezuelan, having surpassed Luis Aparicio in 2009.   McCoy and Valbuena will be the two players looking to beat out Vizquel for a spot on the team. McCoy spent most of the 2011 season shuffling back and forth between the Majors and Minors while serving in a utility role.   Valbuena was acquired from Cleveland during the offseason, but will need to prove he can provide solid defense at shortstop in order to have a chance against McCoy and Vizquel.
