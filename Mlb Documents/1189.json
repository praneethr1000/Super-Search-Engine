    "body": "DENVER -- The Rockies and two of their three arbitration-eligible players -- center fielder Dexter Fowler and right-handed pitcher Jhoulys Chacin -- have a $900,000 gap in their arbitration filings, which were submitted Friday. Fowler is seeking a 2013 salary of $5.15 million while the team is offering $4.25 million. Chacin filed for $2.6 million while the team offered $1.7 million. Also, infielder Jonathan Herrera filed for $1 million while the team filed for $800,000. If team and player can't agree on a contract, the case will go to arbitration, where the player will be assigned either his request or the team's offer. Arbitration hearings will be scheduled Feb. 4-20. Thomas Harding is a reporter for MLB.com. Read his blog, Hardball in the Rockies, and follow him on Twitter @harding_at_mlb.
