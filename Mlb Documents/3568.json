    "body": "Prince Fielder's departure from Milwaukee began in October, when an opposing first baseman stepped back to allow the Brewers' slugger to receive a proper, if unofficial, sendoff.  Perhaps it was a foregone conclusion before Albert Pujols' gesture at Miller Park toward the end of Game 6 of the National League Championship Series, but that's when Fielder's imminent departure became real for many.  Finally, it became official this week when word hit that Fielder and his powerful swing was headed for Detroit, where as Cecil's kid he famously hit homers at Tiger Stadium before he hit his teens. With Tuesday's stunning news that he'd agreed to a nine-year, $214 million deal with the Tigers, Fielder's road from Milwaukee reached its final destination. \"Every year has been a learning experience,\" Fielder said on what turned out to be his last day in a Brewers uniform. \"I don't know, it's been cool, man, and hopefully, I'm here for more years to come. But if not, it's been cool.\"                                John Schlegel is a national reporter for MLB.com. This story was not subject to the approval of Major League Baseball or its clubs.",
