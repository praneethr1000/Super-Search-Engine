    "subtitle": "Center fielder second Pirates player in 20 years to earn prestigious local honor",
    "body": "Andrew McCutchen went out of 2012 the same way he spent the year: Collecting awards and public confirmations of a breakout season.  The Pirates' center fielder just added a big one to his cache: The 2012 Dapper Dan Sportsman of the Year.  It does not get bigger than that, when it comes to the local and regional stages. Presented since 1935, the Dapper Dan is a conspicuous declaration of the Pittsburgh area's outstanding sports personality.
