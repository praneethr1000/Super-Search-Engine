    "body": "ST. PETERSBURG -- Rays fans watching \"American Idol\" on Wednesday night probably weren't too surprised to see Shannon Magrane on the popular show's season premiere.  The talented 16-year-old daughter of Joe Magrane, the Rays' former TV analyst and currently an analyst for MLB Network, has performed the national anthem several times at Tropicana Field.  Shannon sang Etta James' song \"Something's Got a Hold On Me\" and became a unanimous choice to advance to the Hollywood round. \"Shannon has combined God-given ability with hard work, and she couldn't be more excited about this opportunity,\" Joe said. \"Renee [Joe's wife and Shannon's mother] and I don't know where her gift came from, because we can't carry a tune in a bucket. However, this has been a huge thrill for our family.\"   Shannon attends Tampa's Blake High, where she is a sophomore in the arts and drama program. Bill Chastain is a reporter for MLB.com.
