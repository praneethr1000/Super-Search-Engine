    "body": "ATLANTA -- Jorge Sosa's career-best season has netted him his first big payday.  Sosa agreed to a one-year, $2.2 million contract with the Braves on Saturday. The right-hander notched a career-high 13 wins and proved to be a great midseason addition to the Atlanta starting rotation last year.  \"I feel very happy with the deal because we spent a long time negotiating and we avoided arbitration,\" Sosa told an Associated Press reporter before a Winter League game in his native Dominican Republic. When arbitration figures were exchanged earlier this week, the Braves were offering $1.8 million and Sosa was asking for $2.6 million. He made $700,000 during the 2005 season.   Sosa's contract includes a $50,000 bonus that will vest if he throws 205 innings. The 28 year-old hurler, who threw 134 innings while making 44 appearances (20 starts) last year, will come to Spring Training in hopes of keeping his spot in the starting rotation.   After Sosa moved into the rotation in mid-June, he seemed to gain confidence and be more comfortable than he was in the bullpen. As a starter he was 10-3 with a 2.62 ERA.   With the signing, the Braves assured themselves that they won't have to participate in any arbitration hearings. Earlier this month, they signed Chris Reitsma, Marcus Giles, Oscar Villarreal and Horacio Ramirez, their only other arbitration-eligible players. Mark Bowman is a reporter for MLB.com.
