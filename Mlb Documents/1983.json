    "body": "PHILADELPHIA -- The Phillies added to their rotation on Monday, signing veteran right-hander Aaron Harang to a one-year contract, the club announced. Harang will earn a base salary of $5 million, plus performance and awards bonuses. The 36-year-old veteran expects to fill out a rotation that has some question marks heading into Spring Training. As currently constructed, the Phillies' rotation includes Cole Hamels, Cliff Lee, Jerome Williams and David Buchanan. Hamels, of course, could be traded during the offseason and Lee is working his way back from a season-ending elbow injury. Harang gives the Phillies a dependable option as a starter. He went 12-12 with a 3.57 ERA over 33 starts for the Braves in 2014 and finished ninth in the National League with 204 1\/3 innings pitched. He's made 352 starts over 13 seasons in the Majors. \"Aaron brings a wealth of experience and durability to our rotation,\" said general manager Ruben Amaro Jr. \"He had a very solid season for the Braves last year and will complement the left-handers in our rotation nicely.\" Harang seems like a good fit for the Phillies as they enter a rebuilding year. The club needs affordable, short-term options in its rotation, and he fits both categories. In a similar move last offseason, Amaro signed Roberto Hernandez to a one-year deal before later flipping him to the Dodgers in August for a pair of prospects. With Harang under contract, the Phillies now have 39 players on their 40-man roster. Austin Laymance is a reporter for MLB.com. Follow him on Twitter at @jalaymance.
