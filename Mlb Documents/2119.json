    "body": "LOS ANGELES -- Dodgers general manager Farhan Zaidi on Wednesday confirmed the club is very interested in Cuban free-agent infielder Yoan Moncada. Speaking to MLB Network Radio, Zaidi said: \"Moncada, we've scouted extensively. We have the checkbook. Young elite talent in baseball is the most valuable asset to have. To the extent that our evaluation of him matches or exceeds where the market goes, we'll definitely be players for him.\" The Dodgers have had mixed results with Cuban players in recent years, scoring huge with outfielder Yasiel Puig's $42 million signing, but having little to show for spending $53 million on infielders Alex Guerrero and Erisbel Arruebarrena (who was outrighted to Triple-A). \"We're doing all the homework we can,\" Zaidi said. \"With this type of investment, you have to evaluate the talent and the person, understanding the cultural adjustment they have to make. It's all part of the evaluation we have to make. It'll probably be one of those investments where you don't want to leave any stone unturned.\" Moncada is subject to MLB's international bonus signing rules. The penalty for a club exceeding its bonus limit includes a 100-percent tax on its pool overage and prohibition from signing any pool-eligible player for more than $300,000 during the next two signing periods. Moncada, 19, is expected to fetch a signing bonus that could reach $30 million. Ken Gurnick is a reporter for MLB.com.
