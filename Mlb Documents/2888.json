    "body": "Mexican Pacific League Hermosillo 8, Navojoa 3 For six innings, Wednesday's Mexican Pacific League contest between Hermosillo and Navojoa was as tight as you'd expect any Game 7 to be. In the seventh, however, Hermosillo erupted for seven runs -- more than enough to send the club to its first Caribbean Series berth since 2010. Zelous Wheeler, who signed a Minor League deal with the Yankees on Wednesday, hit a three-run homer in the seventh to put the game out of reach as Hermosillo won a do-or-die Game 7 in the second consecutive round of the Mexican Pacific League playoffs. Led by Jerry Owens' three-hit night, Hermosillo rallied back from an early 2-0 deficit. Starter Nathan Reed allowed two third-inning runs, but not much else, as he worked 5 1\/3 four-hit frames. The Hermosillo bullpen held Navojoa in check, not surrendering a run until the ninth. Hermosillo is the final piece in the Caribbean Series puzzle, joining Puerto Rico's Mayaguez, the Dominican Republic's Licey, Venezuela's Magallanes and Cuba's Villa Clara. On Saturday night, Hermosillo will open the round-robin against Villa Clara at Margarita Island in Venezuela -- the host site for the Series. In its history, Hermosillo has only taken the Caribbean crown once, in 1976.Â Box score AJ Cassavell is a reporter for MLB.com. Follow him on Twitter @ajcassavell.
