    "body": "MILWAUKEE -- Remember last year, when the Brewers added left-hander Mike Gonzalez in free agency?  On Monday, they made the signing official.  The Brewers formally announced their one-year pact with the veteran reliever on Monday, a move that could cap general manager Doug Melvin's bullpen makeover. Gonzalez had agreed to the deal, which pays $2.25 million plus incentives, back on Dec. 28, but it remained unofficial until the player passed his physical exam and the team cleared space on its 40-man roster.
