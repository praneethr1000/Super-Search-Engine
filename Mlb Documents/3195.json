    "body": "ST. LOUIS -- As Milwaukee outfielder Ryan Braun continues to appeal a suspension under Major League Baseball's Joint Drug Prevention and Treatment Program, he does so with the support of at least one college teammate. Cardinals outfielder Jon Jay, who played with Braun at the University of Miami, said on Sunday that he has been in touch with his former teammate since word leaked last month that Braun tested positive for a banned substance during the 2011 season. Braun has since said through a spokesperson that the positive test was \"highly unusual\" and that he intends to have his name cleared and not serve a 50-game suspension. \"It's been a difficult situation for him because none of this stuff was supposed to come out,\" Jay said. \"He is due his appeal process. He hasn't really had the chance to comment on everything because he has to let everything take its place. But I'm a big Ryan Braun supporter. He's one of those guys who has helped me out tremendously in my career, and we're great friends. \"It's an unfortunate situation right now, and hopefully everything can get cleared up.\"  A recent report in the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel stated that Braun's case would be heard by a panel of arbiters before the start of Spring Training.  Jay was taken in the 2006 First-Year Player Draft, one year after the Brewers made Braun their first-round pick.",
