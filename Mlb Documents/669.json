    "body": "Yoenis Cespedes' free agency might be entering its final stages. The outfielder's search for a team is \"intensifying,\" according to ESPN's Jim Bowden, who reported the process could conclude within a few days. As many as 10 teams remain in \"active contact\" with Cespedes' camp, Bowden reported. It looked as though Cespedes might be headed to the Orioles, who reportedly made him an offer in the five-year, $90 million range earlier this week. However, Baltimore reportedly agreed to a seven-year, $161 million deal with first baseman Chris Davis on Saturday, likely ending any chance of Cespedes receiving a long-term contract there. On Friday, a Mets source told MLB.com's Anthony DiComo that the club had not made an offer to Cespedes -- who gave New York a huge lift down the stretch in 2015 -- though a one-year deal remained a possibility. The Mets, Braves and White Sox all are known to have interest in Cespedes, according to Ken Rosenthal of FOX Sports, with the Tigers and Angels among the other clubs with a clear need for an outfielder with power. Houston also emerged as a player in the Cespedes sweepstakes Sunday, as Peter Gammons reported on Twitter that he's heard multiple baseball executives link the Astros to the 30-year-old outfielder. The Astros already have a full outfield with George Springer, Carlos Gomez, Colby Rasmus and Preston Tucker in the mix. If the reported interest is legitimate, they could potentially trade one of them to make room for Cespedes. Cespedes batted .291\/.328\/.542 for the Tigers and Mets last season, setting career highs in home runs (35) and RBIs (105). Over four Major League seasons, the Cuba native has hit .271\/.319\/.486, averaging 26 homers and 92 RBIs. Because Cespedes was traded during the season, New York could not make him a qualifying offer, meaning no club would have to surrender a Draft pick to sign Cespedes.
