    "body": "CHICAGO -- Veteran outfielder Marquis Grissom, who has played for six Major League teams and in three World Series, has signed a Minor League contract and has been invited to the Chicago Cubs' big league camp.  Grissom, 38, has spent the last 17 seasons in the Majors, playing for Montreal (1989-'94), Atlanta (1995-'96), Cleveland (1997), Milwaukee (1998-2000), the Los Angeles Dodgers (2001-'02) and San Francisco (2003-'05).  The outfielder has a .272 career average with 386 doubles, 56 triples and 227 homers in 2,165 games. In addition, he has collected 967 RBIs, recorded 429 stolen bases and scored 1,187 runs. He was bothered by a strained hamstring in 2005 and appeared in only 44 games for the Giants. Grissom has played in three World Series, and won a ring in 1995 with Atlanta and current Cubs pitcher Greg Maddux. Grissom batted .360 in the World Series that year. He also reached the World Series in 1996 with the Braves and in '97 with Cleveland. He has a lifetime .317 average in postseason games.   A four-time Gold Glove winner, Grissom was named MVP of the American League Championship Series in 1997, and is a two-time All-Star.   The Cubs also signed infielder Augie Ojeda and outfielder Mike Restovich to Minor League contracts and invited them to Spring Training as well.   Ojeda, 31, has batted .219 in 178 big league contests for the Cubs (2000-2003) and Minnesota (2004). He spent the 2005 season with Triple-A Rochester, batting .224 in 105 games.   Restovich, 27, has seen Major League action over the past five seasons, batting .254 in 127 games. The right-handed hitting outfielder saw his most extensive big league time in 2005, appearing in 52 games for Pittsburgh and 14 games for Colorado.  Carrie Muskat is a reporter for MLB.com.
