    "body": "OAKLAND -- A's right-hander Danny Haren says his father is \"100 percent Irish\" and his mother is \"100 percent Mexican,\" so it was quite a shock for him to find his name on the Netherlands team's provisional roster for the World Baseball Classic. \"They said that somehow they went through and my name has some kind of Dutch descent,\" said a bemused Haren before Saturday's A's FanFest. \"I immediately called my parents and asked them why I would be included in that. They kind of laughed. They didn't know, and we still don't know how I was included.\" Haren, who was born and raised in California, also appears on the provisional roster of the United States. WBC rules allow a player to be listed on the provisional rosters of two of the 16 participating countries, with teams having to submit final 30-man competition rosters five days before their first Round 1 game. The WBC kicks off March 3 and runs through the final game at San Diego's PETCO Park on March 20. Chris Shuttlesworth is an editorial producer for MLB.com.
