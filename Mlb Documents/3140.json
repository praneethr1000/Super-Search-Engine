    "body": "ST. LOUIS -- It's a wonder the 2011 World Series even matched up the Cardinals and Rangers, never mind seeing the clubs play seven stunning, draining, historic games. A twist here, a turn there, and who knows if either even makes it to the Fall Classic.  That's of course especially true of the world champion Redbirds, who made it into the playoffs on the last day of the season. Pitching coach Dave Duncan, on a leave of absence to tend to his convalescing wife, made a special trip to Houston to be with manager Tony La Russa and the Cardinals in case it was La Russa's final game.  It wasn't. That came a month later. It was amazing to watch. But in retrospect, to think about how many ways it might never have happened ... it's difficult even to process. The Rangers still feel like they did everything right, and on paper they likely had the better team. But after 10 days, St. Louis was the world champion.
