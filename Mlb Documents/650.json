    "body": "BOSTON -- The Red Sox have avoided arbitration with Joe Kelly, agreeing on a one-year, $2.6 million contract with the righty. Kelly had an up-and-down 2015 season, going 10-6 with a 4.82 ERA in 25 starts. But he finished strong, reeling off an 8-0 streak from Aug. 1-Sept. 9. This was the first year Kelly was eligible for arbitration. â€¢ Hot Stove Tracker The Red Sox have two other players eligible for arbitration -- righty Junichi Tazawa and lefty Robbie Ross Jr. The deadline for clubs and players to exchange arbitration figures was Friday at 1 p.m. ET. Tazawa asked for $4.15 million, while Boston countered with $2.7 million. Ross filed at $1.325 million and was offered $1.075 million.
