    "body": "NEW YORK -- The Yankees are making one additional spring stop before returning home to open the regular season, having agreed to play in a March 30 exhibition game at the United States Military Academy in West Point, N.Y.  Major League Baseball first announced the Yanks' involvement in the game against the Army baseball team, which is scheduled to be played at 2 p.m. ET at West Point's Johnson Stadium at Doubleday Field.  \"It's a tremendous honor for our organization to play at West Point, which is one of our country's most historically significant institutions,\" said Yankees managing general partner Hal Steinbrenner. \"The Yankees have always held the nation's servicemen and servicewomen in the highest regard. Playing in this game is our way of showing appreciation for their valor and the sacrifices made by all members of the United States armed forces.\" This marks the 22nd exhibition game between the clubs at West Point, dating back to the era when Babe Ruth and Lou Gehrig were in uniform, and the first visit by the Bombers for a game since 1976.   The Yankees and Cadets met for the first time on May 26, 1927, at Doubleday Field. The contest, which featured Ruth, Gehrig and the rest of the Murderer's Row Yankees, was called after an inning and a half due to rain.   The Cadets will be looking for their first win against the Yanks, having come closest to victory in 1966. Army lost, 1-0, in seven innings, as Mickey Mantle drove in the game's only run on a first-inning force out.   Ticket information for the game will be available in late February at www.goarmysports.com.   The West Point exhibition is the Yankees' second preseason game that will take place outside the state of Florida, preceded by a March 29 contest against the Nationals in Washington.
