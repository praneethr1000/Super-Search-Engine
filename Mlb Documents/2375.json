    "body": "MINNEAPOLIS -- Twins president Dave St. Peter kicked off TwinsFest weekend with a state of the franchise address at the annual media luncheon at Target Field on Friday, addressing a wide range of topics, including ticket sales, promotions and the club's Hall of Fame. The biggest news was that for the first time since the Twins Hall of Fame was created in 2000, no one was elected for induction in 2015. The top three vote-getters among players were Dan Gladden, Cesar Tovar and Mudcat Grant, while the top three vote-getters among non-players were John Gordon, Andy MacPhail and Jerry Bell. The Twins didn't have a ceremony last year. \"I'm disappointed that no individual from either the player ballot or the non-player ballot received the necessary votes to receive induction,\" St. Peter said. \"So to that end, we will not have a Twins Hall of Fame inductee in 2015.\" St. Peter also announced that TwinsFest has not sold out any of the three days at Target Field, but that the club expects an estimated 15,000 fans to attend. It's the second straight year the event has been held at Target Field, and the Twins drew roughly 25,000 fans last year. TwinsFest remains one of the largest team-run fan festivals in professional sports, as more than 60 current, former and future Twins players are scheduled to appear throughout the course of this weekend. For more information on tickets and the schedule for TwinsFest this weekend, fans can visit twinsbaseball.com\/twinsfest. St. Peter also addressed ticket sales for the 2015 season, and he said the Twins have sold roughly 70,000 Spring Training tickets for their 17 home games at the renovated Hammond Stadium. St. Peter added that the $48.5 million renovations to the CenturyLink Sports Complex in Fort Myers, Fla., will be completed in the next 7-10 days. Fox Sports North will televise 12 Spring Training games, while Go 96.3, the rebranded radio home of the Twins, will broadcast 14 Spring Training games. As for regular-season tickets, St. Peter said an estimated 1.2 million tickets have been sold and the club had a season-ticket renewal rate of 75 percent. It leaves them with a season-ticket base of about 13,000-14,000, which St. Peter said will still rank as the 10th-13th highest figure among Major League clubs. St. Peter announced several of the Twins' promotional items for the season, as they're set to give away hooded Twins sweatshirts on Opening Day on April 13, and will also have bobblehead days featuring Brian Dozier, Phil Hughes and Paul Molitor. The Twins remain hopeful that the NHL's Minnesota Wild are awarded an outdoor game and that it will be played at Target Field, but St. Peter acknowledged the Wild have also been in talks with TCF Bank Stadium to host a potential game there. Tickets for Opening Day at Target Field went on sale on Friday, while regular-season tickets will go on sale on Feb. 21. Rhett Bollinger is a reporter for MLB.com.
