    "body": "NEW YORK -- The Mets now appear completely set in at least one roster area, agreeing to terms with Ronny Cedeno on a one-year deal. The deal, which multiple reports pegged at slightly more than $1 million, was completed after a physical Friday and should finalize the team's infield depth chart. Cedeno, 28, hit .249 with two home runs in 413 at-bats for the Pirates last season, reaching base at a .297 clip. His primary value to the Mets comes in his ability to play shortstop on a regular basis, giving the team defensive insurance behind starter Ruben Tejada. The club's other backup infielder, Justin Turner, is not a natural shortstop. The Mets fortified a second area of their bench earlier this week, re-signing outfielder Scott Hairston in another deal that is not yet official. As currently constructed, next year's bench should consist of Hairston, infielders Cedeno and Turner, catcher Mike Nickeas and an open competition for the fifth outfield spot. The Mets could still sign a veteran free agent to fill that role, though Minor League outfielders Adam Loewen and Mike Baxter are also candidates. Cedeno's most productive year came in 2010, when he hit .256 with a career-high eight home runs for the Pirates in 468 at-bats.  All that remains on the Mets' offseason wish list is pitching depth, potentially both for the rotation and bullpen. General manager Sandy Alderson said Thursday that he does not anticipate the team making a major trade between now and Opening Day, meaning any acquisitions should come via free agency.
