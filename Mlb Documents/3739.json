    "body": "MILWAUKEE -- Brewers outfielder Nyjer Morgan will have to disperse $2.35 million among his many alter egos after agreeing Monday on a one-year contract, striking another name from the club's list of arbitration-eligible players.  Four remain, including three with the standard three to six years of Major League service time (starter Shaun Marcum and relievers Kameron Loe and Jose Veras) and one very interesting exception in reliever Francisco Rodriguez, who was a free agent before he surprised the Brewers by accepting their arbitration offer in December.  If any of those four players remain unsigned by 1 p.m. ET on Tuesday, they will exchange salary proposals with the team and negotiations will continue until the date of an arbitration hearing in February. If the sides remain in disagreement then, they will present a case to a three-member panel of judges, who select one figure or the other. Adam McCalvy is a reporter for MLB.com.
