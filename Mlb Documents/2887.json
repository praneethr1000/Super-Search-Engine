    "body": "Dominican Winter League Licey 3, Escogido 2 Licey became the Dominican champions Tuesday with a comeback win over Escogido in the eighth game of the best-of-nine series. Rene Rivera hit a game-tying home run in the fifth inning for Licey, and Emilio Bonifacio drove home the go-ahead run on a single in the seventh. Carlos Marmol worked a scoreless eighth in relief, and veteran Juan Cruz locked up the title with a save in the ninth. Box score Venezuelan Winter League  Magallanes 11, Caribes 6 Magallanes blitzed Caribes for 14 hits and 11 runs to win the Venezuelan title on Tuesday night, and two big leaguers -- Endy Chavez and Ramon Hernandez -- finished with four-hit games. Veterans Alberto Callaspo and Juan Rivera combined to score five runs for Magallanes. Magallanes won the first three games of the series, but Caribes answered back in Game 4 before falling in Game 5. Box score  Mexican Winter League Navojoa 5, Hermosillo 3 Navojoa survived a bases-loaded scare in the ninth inning Tuesday night, and it took a crucial victory over Hermosillo to set up a decisive Game 7 on Wednesday. Luis Fonseca doubled and homered for Navojoa, and Hermosillo scratched out two runs in its final at-bat. Hermosillo loaded the bases with one out in the ninth, but a popout and a grounder by Luis Alfonzo Garcia ended the game. Box score  Spencer Fordin is a reporter for MLB.com.
