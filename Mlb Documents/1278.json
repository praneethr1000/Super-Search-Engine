    "subtitle": "Texas believes settlement is near, though, as it hopes to avoid arbitration hearing",
    "body": "The Rangers and David Murphy failed to reach an agreement prior to Friday's noon CT arbitration deadline, with offers by the club and outfielder differing by about $1.5 million.  Murphy, who is expected to be Texas' everyday left fielder, asked for $6.5 million. The Rangers offered $5.05 million.  The Rangers feel they are close to an agreement with Murphy and hope to avoid an arbitration hearing, which would take place in February. Texas hasn't had an actual hearing since 2000 with Lee Stevens. Murphy, 31, has been with the Rangers since 2007. He posted a .304\/.380\/.479 line with 15 homers last season.
