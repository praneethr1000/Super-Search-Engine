    "subtitle": "",
    "body": "The Nationals signed first baseman Adam LaRoche on Tuesday, which is just fine, except for one thing: They already had a first baseman in Michael Morse.  Morse, primarily an outfielder for Washington in 2012, found himself bumped to first base earlier this winter when the Nats acquired Denard Span. The trade moved Bryce Harper out of center field to a corner spot, and with Jayson Werth already on one corner, Morse became the first baseman.  He's not anymore, not with LaRoche signed for two years and $24 million. Matthew Leach is a writer for MLB.com.
