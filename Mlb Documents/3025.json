    "body": "ST. LOUIS -- It's going to be a busy weekend for former Cardinals manager Tony La Russa. A night after he participates in \"A Champ's Perspective\" on Friday, he'll hold his annual \"Stars to the Rescue\" event on Saturday night at the Peabody Opera House in downtown St. Louis.  The event is a benefit for La Russa's Animal Rescue Foundation. This year's evening features Tom Johnston of The Doobie Brothers, Timothy B. Schmit of The Eagles and country star Luke Bryan, among several other acts. A local St. Louis band, Greek Fire, will play an acoustic set to kick off the concert.  The concert gets started at 6:30 p.m. CT on Saturday and tickets cost $25 and $75, with VIP packages at $250. ",
