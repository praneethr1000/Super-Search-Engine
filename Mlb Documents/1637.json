    "body": "SEATTLE -- Lou Piniella can still light up Seattle.  He might be looking tanned, well-rested and stress-free while luxuriating in semi-retirement from his days as an irascible, dirt-kicking baseball manager, but Sweet Lou works a room like no other, especially one in a city he once called his Major League home.  Piniella, who managed the Mariners from 1993-2002 and was at the helm for the franchise's greatest seasons, returned to the Emerald City this week to serve at the keynote speaker at Wednesday's luncheon for the 48th Hutch Award, a national honor presented by the Seattle-based Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center that recognizes a Major League player who has demonstrated outstanding community service.
