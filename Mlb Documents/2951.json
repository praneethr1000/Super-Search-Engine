    "body": "This Hot Stove season is still going strong, but some already are looking ahead to the next one. Red Sox designated hitter David Ortiz is among those, saying in a Sunday night TV interview that \"it might be time to move on,\" if Boston doesn't give him a multiyear extension. The 38-year-old slugger is heading into the final season of his current deal, but MLB.com's Ian Browne writes that it \"seems more likely than not\" that Ortiz will remain with the Red Sox for the remainder of his career. In other news from around the league on Monday: • MLB.com's Doug Miller looks at the offseason's unfinished business in The Week Ahead. • One of the few impact bats remaining on the market belongs to outfielder Nelson Cruz. As MLB.com's Jesse Sanchez writes, Cruz has been linked to the Orioles and Mariners, although it's not impossible that he could return to the Rangers on a one-year deal. • Veteran infielder Michael Young, currently a free agent after finishing 2013 with the Dodgers, likely will retire or return to Los Angeles for another season. • As part of his latest Inbox, Yankees beat reporter Bryan Hoch throws some cold water on the idea of free-agent shortstop Stephen Drew coming to the Bronx. • Left-hander David Huff could make a run at the No. 5 spot in the Giants' starting rotation or fill a long-relief role after the club acquired him from the Yankees last week. • Phillies general manager Ruben Amaro Jr. is still looking for a center fielder to back up Ben Revere but might have to turn to the trade market for a solution. • The Indians and right-hander Justin Masterson have halted negotiations on a long-term extension while they try to compromise on a one-year deal to avoid arbitration. • A handful of utility infielders signed Minor League contracts on Monday. The Indians picked up Elliot Johnson, the Brewers landed Pete Orr and the Reds acquired Chris Nelson, while CBSSports.com reported that the Rockies agreed to a deal with Paul Janish.
