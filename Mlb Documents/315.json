PETERSBURG -- Tampa Bay exchanged figures on Tuesday with the team's five remaining arbitration-eligible players -- first baseman Travis Lee; pitchers Casey Fossum, Jesus Colome and Travis Harper; and catcher Josh Paul. Lee, who returned to the Rays last year after playing for the Yankees in 2004, asked for $2.9 million, and Tampa Bay offered $2 million. Lee played in 129 games last season and recorded a .272 average, 12 home runs and 49 RBIs. He made $1.35 million in 2005. Fossum, who started in the bullpen last season but found his way into the rotation by May, asked for $2.375 million, and the Rays offered $1.7 million. Fossum went 8-12 last season with a 4.95 ERA, and made $950,000. Thomas Simonetti is a contributor to MLB.com. This story was not subject to the approval of Major League Baseball or its clubs.",
