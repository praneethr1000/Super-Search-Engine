    "body": "CHICAGO -- The Cubs exchanged salary figures with Matt Garza on Tuesday, and avoided arbitration with Jeff Baker, Blake DeWitt, Geovany Soto, Ian Stewart, Chris Volstad and Randy Wells.  Garza, 28, submitted $12.5 million while the Cubs countered at $7.95 million. Garza made $5.95 million last season, his first with the Cubs, when he was 10-10 with a 3.32 ERA in 31 starts. He will be a free agent after the 2013 season.  Tuesday was the deadline for teams to exchange salary figures with arbitration-eligible players. Hearings are scheduled for Feb. 1-21 in St. Petersburg, Fla., but the Cubs and Garza could reach an agreement before then. Carrie Muskat is a reporter for MLB.com.
