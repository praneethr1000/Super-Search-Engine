    "body": "Dodgers catcher A.J. Ellis is Gabe Kapler's favorite player. Kapler, who hit .268 during his 12-year career as an outfielder for the Red Sox, Rangers, Rays, Rockies, Tigers and Brewers, is Los Angeles' new director of player development. He called Ellis, who has a .340 OBP in three years as the club's everyday catcher, a \"great teammate and exceptional human being.\" \"That's why he stands out to me. He does a great job providing a platform for his teammates to be heard and appreciated. A.J. checks all of those boxes, and that's why he's my favorite player.\" Ken Gurnick is a reporter for MLB.com. This story was not subject to the approval of Major League Baseball or its clubs.",
