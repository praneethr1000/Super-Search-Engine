    "body": "ST. PETERSBURG -- On the final day to re-sign Alex Gonzalez, the Devil Rays and their everyday third baseman during the 2005 season parted ways.  Gonzalez, who was one of three Tampa Bay free agents entering the offseason, declined to accept arbitration, which meant the Rays had until Sunday to sign him. But no deal was reached.  Gonzalez was looking for a deal that would have given him more playing time than he would have gotten with the Devil Rays, who recently acquired third baseman Sean Burroughs from the Padres in a trade that sent right-hander Dewon Brazelton to San Diego. The other Tampa Bay free agents included first baseman Travis Lee, who accepted arbitration and will be back with the team in 2006, and first baseman\/designated hitter Eduardo Perez, who turned down arbitration and an offer to stay with the Rays. Perez is likely to sign a deal with the Indians as early as Tuesday.   Gonzalez, 32, made 97 starts for the Devil Rays in 2005, primarily at third base (six at shortstop) and hit .269 with nine home runs and 38 RBIs. His two-run homer at Pittsburgh on June 12 came in the 13th inning and ended a seven-game losing streak.   By not signing Gonzalez, the Rays have whittled down their list of third basemen to include Burroughs, utility man Nick Green and perhaps Aubrey Huff, who has played third base in the past.
