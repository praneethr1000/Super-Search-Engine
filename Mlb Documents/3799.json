    "body": "MINNEAPOLIS -- Bert Blyleven's quest to join the hallowed halls of Cooperstown will have to wait at least another year.  The National Baseball Hall of Fame election results were announced Tuesday afternoon, and for the 11th straight year, Blyleven did not receive enough votes for induction.  Only one player was chosen from the ballot by the 543 members of the Baseball Writers' Association of America. After nine years on the ballot, reliever Rich \"Goose\" Gossage received 85.8 percent (466 votes) to finally earn selection. Blyleven's candidacy has been picking up steam over recent years. After receiving just 14 percent of the vote in 1999, his second year on the ballot, Blyleven's vote totals have jumped nearly every year.        Kelly Thesier is a reporter for MLB.com.
