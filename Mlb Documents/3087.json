    "body": "That the Washington Nationals are \"in the Prince Fielder sweepstakes,\" as my MLB.com colleague Bill Ladson has reported, makes perfect baseball and perhaps even fiscal sense in the short-term. With Gio Gonzalez affordably added to what could be a robust rotation, bringing in Fielder for first base would undoubtedly and dramatically improve the Nats' chances in a stacked National League East. And Fielder's mere presence could be a boon to attendance at Nationals Park and help the club's bid to negotiate for a higher cut in its deal with broadcasting partner MASN. But if we know anything about the Fielder negotiations -- and we admittedly don't know much -- it's not to expect this to be a short-term deal. Anthony Castrovince is a reporter for MLB.com.
