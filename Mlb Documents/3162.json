    "body": "ARLINGTON -- The Rangers are ready to install 42-inch high railings around the upper deck of the Ballpark in Arlington and have them ready for Opening Day.  The new railings are in response to the accident that occurred on July 7, when Brownwood firefighter Shannon Stone died as the result of a fall from the left-field seats into an area behind the out-of-town scoreboard. The railings were previously 30-34 inches high, except in front of aisles, which were 42 inches high.  Now all railings will be the same height. The 30-34 inch high railings were within established building codes, but the Rangers decided to raise them to a uniform 42 inches in front of all front row seats on all levels at the Ballpark. T.R.
