    "body": "ARLINGTON -- Paul Lindblad, a middle reliever who pitched in the World Series for the Oakland Athletics and New York Yankees, has died after a long bout with Alzheimer's disease.  Lindblad was diagnosed with Alzheimer's in 1993 and spent the last nine years in a nursing home. He died on New Year's Day. He was 64.  Lindblad pitched 14 seasons, his last game coming for the New York Yankees against the Los Angeles Dodgers in the 1978 World Series. The left-hander was part of two World Series championship teams in Oakland, pitching the ninth and 10th innings to win the Athletics' 11-inning game over the New York Mets in 1973. He didn't make an appearance in the 1974 World Series.   At his funeral last week, Lindblad's casket was flanked by two replica World Series trophies.   The pitcher known as \"Bladder\" was 68-63 with 64 saves with a 3.29 ERA in 655 games for the Kansas City Athletics (1965-67), Oakland Athletics (1968-71 and 1973-76); Washington Senators (1971); Texas (1972 and 1977-78); and the Yankees (1978).   Lindblad was the last pitcher faced by Hall of Famer Willie Mays, who grounded out as a pinch-hitter to end the 11-inning World Series game in 1973. On the final day of the 1975 regular season against the California Angels, Lindblad combined with Vida Blue, Glenn Abbott and Rollie Fingers on a no-hitter.  Copyright 2006 The Associated Press.
