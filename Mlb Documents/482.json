    "body": "One former Chicago sports icon has a new employer, but another one is still looking for work.  As former White Sox slugger Frank Thomas prepares to resume his stellar, but recently injury-marred, Major League career with the Athletics, ex-Cubs star Sammy Sosa continues to be on the outside looking in.  With less than a month before position players report to Spring Training, slammin' Sammy seems to have three choices: 1) sign a Minor League deal with the Washington Nationals and report to camp as a non-roster invitee; 2) accept one of the two offers he has received from teams in Japan or 3) retire. According to MLB.com and other publications, the Nationals are the only MLB team discussing a contract with Sosa. General manager Jim Bowden met with Sammy and his agent, Tom Reich, on Wednesday night in Miami.   In an e-mail Thursday night, Bowden said, \"There has not been an agreement about if it will be a Major or Minor League deal, but both sides are working hard at trying to get an agreement that works with both parties.\"   The Nationals' 40-man roster is full, so if they sign Sosa to a Major League contract, they would have to remove someone from the 40-man to make room and, so far, are unwilling to do that.   Meanwhile, Sosa believes his stature in the game -- 588 career home runs and 1,575 RBIs -- makes him worthy of a guaranteed MLB contract.   However, just 14 of those home runs and 45 of those runs were driven in last season when Sosa played for the Orioles and was paid $17.875 million. And, at age 37, his best years probably are behind him.   As for Thomas, also 37, he will get an opportunity to prove there still is some offensive production remaining in his bat.   Thomas signed for only a $500,000 guarantee, but can earn another $2.6 million based on plate appearances and staying healthy -- avoiding the disabled list with an injury related to his left foot ($325,000 each on May 1 and June 15, then $375,000 on July 15 and Aug. 15) and another $1.2 million by reaching 550 plate appearances.  \"When Frank is healthy, he is a huge right-handed presence,\" Athletics general manager Billy Beane said. \"And that's been a big issue for us the last couple of years.\"   Boy, have things changed in a short period of time for Sosa and Thomas.   As recently as five years ago, Sammy played in 160 games for the Cubs, batted .328, hit 64 home runs and drove in 160 runs.   Two years later, in 2003, The Big Hurt put a big hurt on American League pitchers, hitting 42 home runs and driving in 105 runs for the South Side Sox.   Furthermore, Thomas is one of only 10 players in MLB history with a .300 career batting average, 400 home runs, 1,000 RBIs, 1,000 runs and 1,000 walks. Eight of the others are in the Hall of Fame and the ninth is Barry Bonds.   But in a business where \"What Have You Done Lately?\" is of utmost importance, the offensive numbers Thomas and Sosa accumulated the past couple of years put both on the endangered list.   In the best of worlds, Sosa will find a new home, hit a bunch of home runs, and be a candidate for National League Comeback Player of the Year. And the same goes for Thomas on the West Coast.   In other Friday Hot Stove news:   Done deal ... finally: As had been speculated all week, the Indians shipped left-handed reliever Arthur Rhodes to the Phillies for outfielder Jason Michaels on Friday night, prompting a larger deal that sent Coco Crisp to Boston.   The Indians received righty reliever Guillermo Mota, highly-touted third base prospect Andy Marte, catching prospect Kelly Shoppach, a player to be named later and an undisclosed amount of cash in exchange for Crisp, right-hander David Riske and backup catcher Josh Bard.     Padres: The San Diego Union-Tribune reported that the Padres have been in conversations with free agent catcher Mike Piazza but would offer less than the 12-time All-Star reportedly asked from the Yankees -- $2 million. The paper said Piazza told GM Kevin Towers that he thinks he can catch 70-80 games, play some first base against left-handed pitchers and handle the designated hitter duties in the Padres' nine Interleague road games.     The Phillies, Blue Jays and Angels also have been linked to talks with Piazza, and several reports out of New York on Friday indicated the Yankees no longer were interested.   Devil Rays: The Tampa Tribune reported Friday that the Devil Rays are considering a nickname change.  \"When [new owner] Stu Sternberg came in, he said there was a need for dramatic change. One way for dramatic change is to change the name,\" team president Matt Silverman told the paper, adding that one option is to remove \"Devil\" from the name and make the AL team the \"Rays.\"   The deadline for name changes to be submitted to the Major League office is at the end of May, and Silverman says he expects a new name for the team to be announced in June or July.   Orioles: The agent for catcher Javy Lopez told the Baltimore Sun that the veteran receiver wants either a contract extension or a trade in the next three weeks in light of plans to make Ramon Hernandez the regular catcher. \"Javy's adamant that he wants something done before the beginning of Spring Training,\" Chuck Berry said. \"The ball is in their court at this time.\"   Berry added that Lopez -- who is signed through the 2006 season -- wouldn't cause trouble if a deal can't be worked out.   Reds: General manager Brad Kullman said he has been talking trades pretty much non-stop the last two days. He has contacted nearly every team in baseball and brought in all his top advisers. But that does not mean something is about to happen.   \"There's a chance,\" he said. \"But I don't want to trade Austin Kearns. I don't want to trade Adam Dunn. There are a lot of players on our team who I like. If there was a deal that made absolute sense, we would entertain it and we would talk to Mr. [Bob] Castellini about it, but we haven't had one of those yet.   \"But, the fact is we won 73 games last year and 76 two years ago. Do we want to bring back the same team, minus Sean Casey?\"   Nationals: According to free agent shortstop Royce Clayton, his agent and GM Jim Bowden have had preliminary discussions about possibly joining the Nationals. The 35-year-old Clayton, a 15-year veteran, hit .270 with two home runs and 44 RBIs last season for the Diamondbacks.   Meanwhile, the Nationals agreed to terms on Minor League contracts, including Spring Training invitations, with first baseman Daryle Ward and left-handed relief pitcher Valerio de los Santos. The club also announced that right-handed pitcher Francis Beltran has agreed to terms on a 2006 contract. Jim Street is a reporter for MLB.com.
