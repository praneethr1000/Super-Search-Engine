    "body": "NEW YORK -- The Yankees will play a March 29 exhibition game against the Nationals at Nationals Park in Washington, D.C.  The 2:05 p.m. ET contest will be held one day after the Yankees wrap up their Grapefruit League schedule, with their final Florida game set for March 28 against the Pirates at George M. Steinbrenner Field in Tampa, Fla.  Single-game tickets for the New York-Washington exhibition will go on sale through the Nationals at a date to be determined. A portion of the proceeds from the exhibition will benefit the Washington Nationals Dream Foundation, a 501 (c) 3 charitable organization committed to improving the lives of children throughout the Washington capital region.
