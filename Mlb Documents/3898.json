    "body": "The status of baseball's future -- and indeed, its very existence -- in Miami is about to become clear. Marlins officials will attempt to finalize plans for a new baseball stadium when they meet with the Miami-Dade County Commission on Thursday morning. The meeting, originally scheduled for last month, could finally bring an end to an issue that has divided team and county officials for years. There are, however, no guarantees. Should the two parties not reach an agreement on the last details of the $525 million project, then the deal will again hinge on uncertainty. The Marlins are set to commit $155 million of their own money to the stadium, and they received a pledge of $50 million from the county in a general-obligation bond last month. Team president David Samson lauded that decision at the time, while knowing that a greater one still awaited.  \"This is the biggest vote to date,\" Samson said in December. \"But the next vote would be the biggest vote ever.\"  That next vote, which is set to occur Thursday, should be the last major hurdle in negotiations that have been ongoing for the better part of a decade. If the deal passes, the Marlins will begin construction on a shiny new retractable-roof stadium, which would open in 2011 and guarantee the team's presence in Miami for at least the next 30 years.  Some details remain unresolved, but the basic framework -- a 37,000-seat stadium on the site of the old Orange Bowl -- is all but finished. Upon completion of the stadium, the team would change its name to the Miami Marlins, in perhaps the most tangible sign of a new era of Marlins baseball.  All of this is part of a multibillion-dollar project that also includes funds for a downtown streetcar, housing developments, a soccer stadium and a tunnel for the Port of Miami. The stadium plan would require no state money, instead relying fully on local and private funds.  The team is also looking into ways to reduce the cost of building a retractable roof. One such strategy would be to mimic the \"sail design\" that the Tampa Bay Rays recently introduced for their new stadium, which would save money by only cooling portions of the ballpark where fans actually sit.  The team's current lease at Dolphin Stadium, where the Marlins have played since their inaugural 1993 season, ends in 2010. Anthony DiComo is a reporter for MLB.com.
