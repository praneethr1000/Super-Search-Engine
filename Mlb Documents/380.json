    "body": "TEMPLE, Texas -- The Houston Astros feel that Jeff Bagwell will be unable to contribute a healthy season in 2006, and two doctors that have examined the first baseman have officially agreed. Now it's up to the insurance company to make its call.  After receiving feedback from team medical director Dr. David Lintner and orthopedic surgeon Dr. James Andrews, the Astros are moving forward with their plans to file an insurance claim on Bagwell, who was deemed by the doctors as a disabled player. The claim, according to club owner Drayton McLane, will be filed on Tuesday.  This is not the earth-shattering news. What happens in the coming weeks could be, because the Astros essentially have one month to figure out a way to prevent Bagwell from heading to Kissimmee, Fla., on Feb. 23 when position players report to Spring Training.
