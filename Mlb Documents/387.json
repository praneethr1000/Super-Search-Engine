    "body": "DENVER -- Colorado standout first baseman Todd Helton underwent what the club classified as \"minor\" surgery on his right (non-throwing) elbow on Monday morning.  The operation, performed by Rockies medical director Dr. Thomas Noonan at the Steadman-Hawkins Clinic in Greenwood Village, Colo., was to remove a \"loose body\" from the elbow. Helton suffered the injury while working out at Coors Field.  Helton is expected to be fully able to begin Spring Training next month. The first full-squad workout is scheduled for Feb. 24 in Tucson, Ariz. \"This was a minor procedure that we expect will sideline Todd for a couple of weeks,\" Rockies general manager Dan O'Dowd said in the club's official statement. \"We anticipate him being completely recovered for the start of Spring Training.\"   Helton has the highest batting average among active players with 3,000 or more plate appearances, at .337. Helton started 2005 poorly -- a start that, it was revealed recently, was attributable to a back problem that occurred before Spring Training. But starting July 1, the first baseman batted .383 to bring his final average to .320.  Thomas Harding is a reporter for MLB.com.
