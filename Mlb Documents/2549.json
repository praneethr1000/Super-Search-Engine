    "body": "MIAMI -- The Marlins have intensified talks with 10-time All-Star outfielder Ichiro Suzuki and are open to a possible two-year deal, MLB.com has learned. Multiple reports on Saturday said talks between the two sides were progressing. Miami is searching for a fourth outfielder, and the 41-year-old appears to be its primary target. Suzuki, a career .317 hitter, has 2,844 hits over 14 MLB seasons. Currently sitting 156 hits shy of the 3,000 mark, a two-year deal could help him reach the milestone in a Marlins uniform. A member of the Yankees since midway through the 2012 season, Suzuki appeared in 143 games and batted .284 with a .324 on-base percentage in 385 plate appearances in '14. His role with the Marlins would be as a fourth outfielder and a left-handed pinch-hitting option. Along with Suzuki, the Marlins have also had conversations with another left-handed-hitting, free-agent outfielder, Nate Schierholtz. Joe Frisaro is a reporter for MLB.com.
