    "body": "TUCSON -- The Diamondbacks announced on Tuesday that they had avoided salary arbitration with right-handers Claudio Vargas and Brandon Lyon, catcher Johnny Estrada and infielders Orlando Hudson and Alex Cintron, signing each to a one-year contract.  Lyon, who began last year as the team's closer and saved 13 games before suffering an elbow injury that kept him on the shelf from May 13 to Aug. 12, signed a deal worth $830,000.  The D-Backs claimed Vargas off waivers from Washington in early June last year, and for an 11-game stretch from June 21 to Aug. 18, he was the club's best pitcher as he went 7-2 with a 2.82 ERA. On Dec. 7, the Diamondbacks acquired Estrada, who hit .261 with the Braves last season, in a trade that sent relievers Oscar Villarreal and Lance Cormier to Atlanta.    Cintron, who has been the subject of trade rumors, will make $1.6 million. Speculation has been that the switch-hitter could be dealt for a left-handed specialist to bolster the Arizona bullpen.   In his third full season, Cintron hit .273 in 122 games with the Diamondbacks last year.   In other Diamondbacks news, infielder Craig Counsell and outfielder Luis Gonzalez were named to Team USA's provisional roster for the World Baseball Classic.
