    "body": "CLEVELAND -- The Indians have extended non-roster Spring Training invitations to six players from within the organization's farm system.  Right-hander Chen-Chang Lee, who earned the 2011 Bob Feller Award as Cleveland's Minor League Pitcher of the Year, will be among the non-roster players in camp with the Tribe this spring.  Lee went 6-1 with a 2.40 ERA in 44 games between Double-A Akron and Triple-A Columbus last season. Over 71 1\/3 innings, Lee struck out 99 and limited righties to a .197 average. Joining Lee from the Indians' system will be right-handers Austin Adams, Tyler Sturdevant and Hector Ambriz, catcher Chun Chen and outfielder Chad Huffman. As things currently stand, Cleveland will have 15 players in camp as non-roster invitees.   Other invitees include pitchers Chris Ray, Robinson Tejeda and Chris Seddon, catchers Luke Carlin, Michel Hernandez and Matt Pagnozzi, infielders Andy LaRoche and Jose Lopez and outfielder Felix Pie.",
