    "body": "Carlos Pena is returning to the Rays after spending a year away, the club announced Tuesday.  The 33-year-old first baseman's one-year contract is worth $7.25 million. Pena spent the 2007-10 seasons with Tampa Bay before joining the Cubs as a free agent last offseason, and his two best seasons came with the Rays (46 home runs in '07, 39 in '09).  Pena's home run total for the Cubs last year (28) matched his output with the Rays in 2010. He hit .225 with a .357 on-base percentage in 2011, marks that are in line with his respective .239 and .352 clips lifetime. Pena will take a pay cut from his $10 million salary a year ago.
