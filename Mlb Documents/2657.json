    "body": "While Brandon Beachy is reportedly \"getting stronger\" coming off a second Tommy John surgery, his agent told FOXSports.com's Ken Rosenthal that the free-agent right-hander intends to wait until closer to Spring Training to make a decision about signing with a club. \"Brandon has decided not to sign a contract at this time,\" Beachy's agent, Rob Martin, told Rosenthal. \"With each day his arm is getting stronger and he's feeling even more confident about his progress. Thus, he is going to continue with his throwing program and make a decision closer to Spring Training.\" Beachy, 28, has not pitched in the Majors since Aug. 20, 2013. Over the course of four seasons with the Braves, he is 14-11 with a 3.23 ERA in 46 starts. Joey Nowak is a reporter for MLB.com. Follow him on Twitter at @joeynowak.
