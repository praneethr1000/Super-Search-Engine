    "body": "CHICAGO -- Gonzalez Germen has traveled quite a bit this offseason without going anywhere. On Friday, the Cubs claimed Germen off waivers from the Rangers. The right-handed pitcher was designated for assignment by the Mets on Dec. 15, and he was traded to the Yankees four days later. Germen was then designated for assignment on Jan. 13, before being traded to the Rangers on Tuesday. With the move, the Cubs' 40-man roster is now full. Germen, 27, went 1-2 with one save and a 4.31 ERA in 54 relief appearances over the last two seasons with the Mets. He struck out 64 batters over 64 2\/3 innings, and he limited opponents to a .248 batting average, including a .229 mark by right-handed hitters. Last season, Germen appeared in 25 games for the Mets, compiling a 4.75 ERA. He missed a month because of a virus and abscess. Carrie Muskat is a reporter for MLB.com.
