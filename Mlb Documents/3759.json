    "body": "SEATTLE -- When Jesus Montero was 11 years old, he was home in Venezuela watching a baseball game on TV with his father. The team at the plate was the Mariners, the batter was vintage Edgar Martinez, and the result was something as familiar to Seattle fans as raindrops pelting the Kingdome roof.  Double to right field.  \"I told my father, 'You're going to see me on TV one day,'\" Montero, the newest Mariners slugger, said Thursday at the club's annual pre-Spring Training luncheon at Safeco Field. \"[I told him] I'm going to be like [Martinez] one day, hitting the ball to right field.\" Doug Miller is a reporter for MLB.com.
