    "body": "CHICAGO -- The Cubs added a veteran right-handed outfielder on Friday, signing free agent Chris Denorfia to a one-year, $2.6 million contract that includes $400,000 in incentives. Denorfia, 34, is a career .272 hitter over all or part of nine seasons with the Reds, Athletics, Padres and Mariners. He's played all three outfield positions, and he has a career .292 average against left-handed pitchers. He's also had success in the National League Central (.298 career batting average) and at Wrigley Field (.339). Denorfia spent parts of five seasons with the Padres, mostly serving in a platoon role in the outfield, before he was traded to the Mariners last July for a pair of Minor Leaguers. His .230 batting average and .602 OPS in 2014 were each career lows. To make room on the Cubs' 40-man roster, left-handed pitcher Mike Kickham was designated for assignment. Kickham, 26, was claimed off waivers from the Giants on Dec. 23. Former Cubs catcher John Baker first reported Denorfia's signing with the Cubs on Twitter. Baker and Denorfia were teammate on the Padres from 2012-13. The addition of Denorfia gives the Cubs a veteran outfielder to go along with Ryan Sweeney, Jorge Soler, Chris Coghlan, Arismendy Alcantara and Junior Lake. Carrie Muskat is a reporter for MLB.com.
