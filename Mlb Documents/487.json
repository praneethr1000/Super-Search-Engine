    "body": "The final analysis won't be available for several years, but the Padres feel they mined a rich supply of gold in the 2005 First-Year Player Draft, from first-round picks Cesar Carrillo and Cesar Ramos down through the ranks.  \"We feel like it was a great draft,\" said Grady Fuson, the club's chief of scouting and development. \"We got a lot of young players who have a shot at having outstanding careers.\"  Venturing forward with a bold new design under club president Sandy Alderson, the former A's championship architect who believes in building from within with a lush crop of farm hands, the Padres were thrilled with the early returns on their '05 draft class. From Americus, Ga., Carter could make his homestate Braves regret not making him their own. Southpaws who figure out ways to consistently frustrate hitters tend to last a long time. If there's a model for Carter to follow, it would seem to be the great Tom Glavine, whose remarkable command and poise made him one of the game's great pitchers for years, notably with the Braves.                 Venable debuted with the Arizona Rookie League Padres, batting .322 in 15 games with a .385 on-base and .508 slugging marks. Moving up to Eugene, he batted .216 with .295 on-base and .324 slugging, experiencing predictable growing pains. He's expected to open the '06 season at Fort Wayne.
