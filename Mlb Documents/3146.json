    "body": "LOS ANGELES -- The Dodgers extended the deadline for opening bids for the sale of the club by 10 days on Tuesday.  The new deadline is Jan. 23. The sale agreement between the Dodgers and MLB calls for owner Frank McCourt to present a winning bidder on April 1, with the sale closing April 30.  Potential bidders received confidential financial information from the club two weeks ago. Still to be determined is whether the club's future broadcasting rights will also be auctioned, as the Dodgers desire and a U.S. bankruptcy court approved. However, that ruling is being challenged by FOX Sports, which holds the current rights and has appealed to a U.S. District Court, which issued an emergency stay to stop marketing of the rights and will hear arguments Jan. 12.
