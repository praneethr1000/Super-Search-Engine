    "body": "A couple of veteran catchers still looking for jobs and another receiver getting ready to make his Major League debut have the Hot Stove burner on low heat heading into the final full week of January.  For MLB vets Bengie Molina and Mike Piazza, it has become a game of \"Catch As Catch Can.\"  So far, neither Molina nor Piazza has caught on with another MLB organization, and pitchers and catchers report to Spring Training in less than a month. According to published reports, the Blue Jays seem to be the most interested in the pair of catchers, but definitely won't sign both. Meanwhile, 11-year Japanese veteran Kenji Johjima, regarded as the best Japanese catcher of his era, has arrived in Seattle. He'll be introduced to the local media on Tuesday, spend a few days in the Emerald City, and then depart for Peoria, Ariz., for an early jump on Spring Training.   Johjima departed his homeland on Sunday.   \"Finally this day has come,\" he told Kyodo News Service and other Japanese media outlets at a news conference before his departure. \"I look forward to seeing how I improve as a baseball player through overcoming various barriers.\"   Johjima, who has been working with tutors in Japan to teach him English, said he is in good physical shape and has a good idea of the new pitchers he soon will be catching -- thanks to recent conversations with former Mariners reliever Shigetoshi Hasegawa.   \"I have trained quickly and smoothly,\" he said. \"I also spoke with [Hasegawa] to confirm what I have learned about the Mariners pitching staff from videos.\"  After spending the past eight seasons with the Angels, Molina has great knowledge of American League hitters and is coming off his finest season -- .295 batting average, 15 home runs and 69 RBIs for the AL West Division champions.   And, at just 31 years of age, he's just now entering what should be the prime seasons of his career.   Molina certainly thinks so and he told the Yuma (Ariz.) Sun over the weekend that he would sit out the upcoming season if he doesn't receive the annual salary he is seeking, which is believed to be in the $6 million range.     \"I think I have done enough to deserve something,\" Molina told the paper on Saturday while attending an alumni game at Arizona Western Community College. \"If I don't get that type of deal, I think I'm willing to sit out and see what happens next year. I hope it doesn't come to that.\"   Molina, who played 119 games last season, made $3 million and the Jays reportedly have offered about $4 million.   Also, according to Monday's New York Post, Toronto is still interested in Piazza, providing he would sign a one-year deal. Piazza, a 12-time All-Star catcher with the Dodgers and Mets, would be expected to catch no more than 70 games and double as the designated hitter.   The Chicago Tribune reported Monday that though Sammy Sosa does not yet have a team for '06, he won't be playing in Japan. He has received offers from at least two Japanese teams, sources told the Japan Times. Meanwhile, the Nationals have expressed interest in Sosa.   In other Hot Stove news:   Marlins: It appears that if the Marlins acquire center fielder Joey Gathright from the Devil Rays, the deal would be made sometime during Spring Training. Neither team seems to be in a rush as the Marlins have an abundance of young pitching prospects they can use in the deal. But the team wants to evaluate their young arms on the field before deciding who to part with. Tampa Bay, meanwhile, views Gathright as an insurance policy for Rocco Baldelli, who is returning from injury.   Red Sox: While the team prepares to announce the return of former general manager Theo Epstein in a full-time baseball operations capacity, the Red Sox were also busy Monday reportedly readying physicals for two players about to be acquired via trade and free agency. The Boston Globe reported that the Indians and Red Sox have agreed in principle on swap that would send Crisp, setup man David Riske and catcher Josh Bard to Boston for top prospect Andy Marte, Guillermo Mota and catching prospect Kelly Shoppach. Crisp would fill two pressing needs for Boston -- a speedy center fielder who could bat leadoff. The Boston Herald reported that free agent shortstop Alex Gonzalez would soon undergo a physical and if he passes, finalize a contract. The former Marlin, who had minor arthroscopic surgery on his right elbow after each of the last two seasons, would be ready for Spring Training, according to the publication.     Phillies: The Phils may have ended its long search for relief help by acquiring left-hander Arthur Rhodes from the Indians for outfielder Jason Michaels, according to a report in The Philadelphia Inquirer. The report said such a deal was contingent on Cleveland and Boston completing a swap that would send outfielder Indians outfielder Coco Crisp to Boston for reliever Guillermo Mota and infielder Andy Marte. Michaels would likely replace Crisp in one of the outfield spots. Rhodes, 36, would likely become Philadelphia's primary setup man for closer Tom Gordon, and guarantee Ryan Madson's shift to the starting rotation. The paper said an announcement could come early this week.   Athletics: Former White Sox DH Frank Thomas is nearing the signing of a one-year, incentive-rich contract with the Athletics, according to the Chicago Sun-Times. Thomas' doctors say the free agent slugger is ahead of schedule in his recovery from foot surgery.   Orioles: The Baltimore Sun reported on Sunday that the Orioles are close to signing Jay Gibbons to a contract extension that would take him through his first year of free agency. The signing could be finalized sometime this week.   Giants: Outfielder Randy Winn had the option year of his contract picked up soon after the 2005 season ended and he might get a new deal long before the current one ends. Winn and GM Brian Sabean crossed paths in San Francisco over the weekend. \"He said, 'I'd like to talk to you about contract extension, and I'll call you in a week and a half,'\" Winn said. \"So who knows what'll happen?\" Winn told the  Oakland Tribune. The Danville, Calif., native performed superbly for the Giants after being acquired from Seattle on July 30 for Jesse Foppert and Yorvit Torrealba. In 58 games, Winn hit .359 with 14 home runs, scored 39 runs and had 26 RBIs. Winn also became the first Giant in six years to hit for the cycle, pulling off the feat on Aug. 15 -- his 13th game with the club. Winn, who could be eligible for free agency at the end of the 2006 season, hit .447 in September and collected 51 hits, the most by a Giant in any single month in at least the past 30 years.
