    "body": "NEW YORK -- About one calendar year has passed since Carlos Beltran stood behind a podium in the Diamond Club at Shea Stadium, leaned toward a microphone and softly proclaimed his team the \"New Mets.\"  It was a catchy slogan, for sure -- one that shortly was to adorn the club's literature and marketing programs, helping inspire excitement and confidence in the team's successful 2005 season.  Now, 12 months later, and with new teammates Carlos Delgado, Paul Lo Duca and Xavier Nady joining the offensive attack, it is again Beltran who sounds as enthusiastic as anyone concerning the Mets' offseason upgrades. \"I just believe this has to be our year,\" Beltran said via telephone from Puerto Rico. \"If we stay healthy and we find a way to play the game right, I don't see why we can't win the division.\"   One winter after the free agent signings of Beltran and Pedro Martinez, the centerpiece of the Mets' offseason activity this time around was arguably the Nov. 24 trade with the Marlins for Delgado. Coupled with the signing of free agent closer Billy Wagner that same week, the deals appear to give New York a significant boost in the National League East.   Beltran revealed Thursday that he was actually the first to break news of the trade to Delgado, whom Beltran considers his best friend. Rolling out of bed, Beltran saw reports of the trade on television and called a surprised Delgado at home -- the first of 10 or 15 conversations between the two Mets stars since then.   \"I couldn't believe it at the beginning,\" Beltran said. \"I was very happy. The ballclub is getting a lot more power, and at the same time, he was a guy the Mets were trying to look for last year. This year, we have him, and he's going to be a key player for our ballclub.\"   Of the topics discussed between Beltran and Delgado, apparently an upcoming change of lifestyle to New York was not one of them.   But Delgado handled the New York media with aplomb during his introductory press conference in November, while promising to provide a left-handed power bat in the lineup that Beltran and the Mets hope to take full advantage of -- no transition period necessary.   \"He's ... a guy [of] his word,\" Beltran said. \"Sometimes here in Puerto Rico, when you do activities, some other players say, 'Yeah, I'll be there, I'll be there,' and they never show up. He's a guy who if he says he's going to be there, he'll always show up.\"   In his first season with the Mets, Beltran played in 151 games, batting .266 with 16 home runs, 78 RBIs and 17 stolen bases. It remains unclear where Beltran will hit in the lineup this year; most of his at-bats came in the No. 3 spot in 2005, although the landscape of the lineup may have changed with the offseason renovations.       Slowed early in the 2005 campaign by an ailing quadriceps, followed by a concussion and facial fractures in a frightening collision with Mike Cameron in August, Beltran admits injuries played a large role last year.   He points toward the promise of a healthy 2006 as an opportunity to show New York the real Carlos Beltran.   \"I feel great right now,\" Beltran said. \"I've been training full-time and doing a lot of activity, and I don't feel anything on my face. When that happened to me, a month after it happened, there were a few times when I felt dizzy once in a while. Now, I feel great, and I'm just very happy.\"   Since returning home, Beltran said he has worked out intensively at a nearby stadium every day in anticipation of Spring Training and the upcoming World Baseball Classic, in which Beltran is primed to represent his native Puerto Rico.   \"For me, 2005 was a year of adjustment,\" Beltran said. \"Playing my whole career with a small-market team and being able to sign with a big-market team like New York, it was a little bit different.   \"At the same time, I feel happy with everything that I did. This year, 2006, I'm looking forward to staying healthy the whole season. I know that if I stay healthy, the numbers and everything I'm capable of doing, I will do it.\"   Six-packs on the way: The Mets announced Thursday that beginning on Jan. 11, fans can purchase seven different six-packs of tickets for the 2006 season. A six-pack is a ticket to six separate games, including one game against the Yankees. The different packs are Power, Championship, All-Star, Rival, Pedro, Family and '86.
