    "body": "PHILADELPHIA -- Third baseman Pedro Feliz toiled in obscurity while playing in San Francisco for all of this century, while a certain controversial slugger shattered Hank Aaron's all-time home run mark. Thousands of miles away, on a different coast and with a new team, Feliz may enjoy the same relative anonymity as a member of a stacked infield that is arguably the best foursome in the National League. It's hard to stand above when two members of that quartet have won the past two NL Most Valuable Player Awards, and the other is the league's best second baseman. But being an unknown is fine with Feliz. \"After we made a two-year offer and it was dismissed out of hand, we felt we needed to move on,\" Giants GM Brian Sabean told the San Francisco Chronicle.
