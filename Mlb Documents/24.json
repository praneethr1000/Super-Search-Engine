    "body": "Spring Training is approaching like a Bobby Jenks fastball, and that's a good thing.  The words \"pitchers and catchers report\" can remove the chill from the coldest places in North America, create the smell of freshly mowed grass, visions of tall palm trees bending in the breeze, and umpires in Florida and Arizona yelling, \"Play ball!\"  Well, a Spring Training like none other begins in less than three weeks. The Tigers, Angels, Mariners, Rangers, Cubs, Dodgers and Giants will be the first Major League teams to open camps -- all on Feb. 16 -- and the Twins will be the last, with their first day of workouts set for Feb. 20. All camps will be going full bore by Feb. 25, nearly five weeks before Opening Day.   What makes this Spring Training unique is the World Baseball Classic.   While it'll be business as usual for a majority of the players invited to camp, some of the game's biggest stars will be playing for their respective countries in the inaugural WBC from March 3-20. Those players have the option of reporting to their MLB camp as early as Wednesday.   Fans attending Cactus and Grapefruit League games this spring have the option of also checking out some of the 16 WBC teams. Canada, Panama, Venezuela, Italy, the Netherlands, the Dominican Republic, Puerto Rico and Australia have workouts and exhibition games scheduled in Florida the first week of March, while Mexico, South Africa, the United States and the two Asian qualifiers from Round 1 in Tokyo will share camp facilities with teams based in Arizona.   It could be a win-win situation.      According to Dan Schlossberg, president of the North American Travel Journalists Association, the six-week Spring Training period usually injects $450 million into the Florida economy, but the number will jump in 2006 because of the WBC.   Pat Courtney, a Major League Baseball spokesman, told the Arizona Republic recently that interest in the WBC could boost Cactus League attendance as well.   \"You will have more people coming out to watch more of these games,\" Courtney said. \"The goal was to try not to directly affect the attendance at Spring Training games.\"   Some Cactus League teams, such as the Giants in Scottsdale and the Mariners and San Diego Padres in Peoria, actually will get additional dates from exhibition games played against Classic teams, he said.   The Giants will play Team USA on March 5, while the Padres and Mariners will play the two Asian teams that win Pool A play -- scheduled for March 3-5 in Tokyo -- later that week. The Royals and Rangers also have exhibition games scheduled against the Asian teams in Surprise, Ariz.   Close to 400 players currently on MLB organizations' 40-man rosters are candidates to compete in the WBC. That number will decrease when the teams select their final 30-man rosters prior to the tournament.   As teams are eliminated, players will return to their respective MLB teams for the remainder of Spring Training. Some players will play as few as three WBC games. Others could play as many as seven games.   \"[Organizations] understand that when they get their players back, they'll have a log of exactly what they've done,\" Team USA manager Buck Martinez said. \"When they get back to their teams, they'll have two weeks to resume Spring Training to get ready for the season.\"   And once they return to their parent MLB team, some will find new teammates.   Among star players changing teams this season are: Johnny Damon (Red Sox to Yankees), A.J. Burnett (Marlins to Blue Jays), Kevin Millwood (Indians to Rangers), B.J. Ryan (Orioles to Blue Jays), Troy Glaus (Diamondbacks to Blue Jays), Kris Benson (Mets to Orioles), Rafael Furcal (Braves to Dodgers), Sean Casey (Reds to Pirates), Jim Thome (Phillies to White Sox), and Matt Morris (Cardinals to Giants).   Indeed, a spring to remember is almost here. Jim Street is a reporter for MLB.com. This story was not subject to the approval of Major League Baseball or its clubs.",
