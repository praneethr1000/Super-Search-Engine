    "body": "PHILADELPHIA -- The Phillies' offseason search for much-needed bullpen help may have led them to the Cleveland Indians, and one of three possibilities. Multiple baseball sources suggested Monday that outfielder Jason Michaels may be dealt to the Indians for either Guillermo Mota, Arthur Rhodes or David Riske. Representatives from the Phillies declined to comment, citing a policy of not discussing trade rumors. Such a deal is contingent on Boston and Cleveland completing the speculated swap that would send Indians outfielder Coco Crisp to Boston for Mota and prospect Andy Marte. That deal is reportedly pending physicals, a stage the Phillies and Indians would have to complete before their deal could be announced. Mota, 32, is familiar with the National League East after spending the past 1 1\/2 years with the Marlins. Last season wasn't his best, as he posted a 4.70 ERA in 56 games. He'll earn $3 million this season.   Ken Mandel is a reporter for MLB.com. This story was not subject to the approval of Major League Baseball or its clubs.",
