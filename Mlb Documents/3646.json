    "body": "HOUSTON -- Astros owner Jim Crane announced Thursday that team president of business operations Pam Gardner has voluntarily resigned and will take a role as special adviser to Crane.  Gardner had been with the Astros for 23 years, serving as president for the past 11 years, and was the longest-tenured female executive in Major League Baseball. She oversaw all business and financial aspects for the Astros.  \"The Astros have been a very important part of my life for more than 23 years,\" Gardner said in a statement. \"It truly has been a joyful and rewarding experience. I'm very proud of what we have been able to accomplish as an organization and the important role the Astros play in the life of our city and region. \"With the upcoming 50th anniversary of the club and the 2013 move to the American League, this is an ideal time for a fresh start. The Astros are in very good hands with Jim Crane and his impressive ownership group. The best is yet to come.\"   In a statement, Crane said: \"Pam's leadership has been instrumental to the Astros success and reputation for many years. She is an invaluable resource and we look forward to her continued service to the Astros in her new role.\"   Gardner has been recognized professionally on several occasions over the years, most recently being named one of 20 women listed as \"Game Changers\" by Street and Smith's Sports Business Journal in 2011. She received the prestigious Marguerite Ross Barnett leadership award from the Houston Area Urban League in 2008.   Gardner was recognized by the Sports Business Journal as one of the 20 Most Influential Women in Sports, and a year later became the first female inducted into the Texas Baseball Hall of Fame. She was also included in a special exhibit at the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum in Cooperstown, saluting women in baseball.   Under Gardner's leadership, Comcast Sports Net Houston was formed in the fall of 2010 and will televise Astros and Rockets games beginning in 2012-13, as well as other team programming. She also played a major role in the building of Minute Maid Park (formerly Enron Field), and oversaw the completion of the Urban Youth Academy in northwest Houston.  In 2011, she helped plan and implement two new HD video scoreboards at Minute Maid Park and the private Insperity Club behind the home-plate area. During her tenure, she led the Astros business group in hosting playoff events at Minute Maid Park, including the 2004 All-Star Game and the first World Series game played in Texas in 2005.   Gardner originally joined the Astros in 1989 as director of communications, developing advertising and marketing campaigns for the club. In 1994, she was named director of marketing, where her role expanded to include more strategic planning. Gardner became vice president of marketing in 1996, overseeing advertising, marketing and ticket sales for the Astros, with emphasis on growing general revenue areas.   Gardner was named senior vice president of sales and marketing in 1999, and added sponsorship sales and marketing operations to her responsibilities. She spearheaded the advertising and marketing efforts for both the team and the new ballpark in its inaugural season and led the development of the new logo and uniform design that the team currently utilizes.  Gardner currently serves on the board of the Astros in Action Foundation; the board and executive committee of Central Houston Inc., which she will chair in 2012; and is a member of Texas Executive Women and the Greater Houston Partnership. She is a member of the board of directors of Newfield Exploration Company. Brian McTaggart is reporter for MLB.com and writes an MLBlog, Tag's Lines. Follow @brianmctaggart on Twitter.
