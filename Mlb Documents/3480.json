    "body": "ARLINGTON -- Yu Darvish is undertaking the journey from Japan to the U.S. with the intention of helping the Rangers achieve their goal of winning a World Series championship.  That is one of the reasons why he is coming to Texas and why the Rangers are willing to invest approximately $112 million in the 25-year-old right-hander, who has spent the past seven years pitching for the Hokkaido Nippon Ham Fighters in Japan's Pacific League.  In the end it's all about winning, and that's why the Rangers worked so hard to bring negotiations to a successful conclusion before Wednesday's 4 p.m. CT deadline. Darvish is to be introduced at a news conference Friday at 7 p.m. CT. It can be seen live on MLB.com and texasrangers.com. The Rangers spent the past two years both scouting Darvish and developing a personal relationship with him. They also spent countless hours talking to as many people as possible to get a better feel as to how he would make the transition to the U.S.              The Rangers made a much more sizable financial investment in Darvish.
