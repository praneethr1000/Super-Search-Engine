    "body": "HOUSTON -- The Houston Astros have reached a tentative agreement with left-hander Trever Miller on a one-year contract with a vesting option for 2007, according to an ESPN.com report. An announcement regarding Miller's contract could be made as early as Monday, pending a physical. General manager Tim Purpura prefers not to comment on deals before they are official.  If Miller is signed, he will give manager Phil Garner a second left-handed option out of the bullpen, joining Mike Gallo, the relief corps' lone lefty specialist during the Astros' run to a National League championship in 2005. Miller, 32, pitched for Houston in 1998 and '99. Through his seven-year big league career, he has played for the Tigers, Astros, Phillies, Dodgers and Devil Rays.  In 2005, Miller was 2-2 with a 4.06 ERA over 61 appearances for Tampa Bay. Alyson Footer is a reporter for MLB.com. This story was not subject to the approval of Major League Baseball or its clubs.",
