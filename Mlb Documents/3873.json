    "body": "ARLINGTON -- Left-hander Eddie Guardado is on board and Jamey Wright is coming back. The Rangers bullpen will be full of competition and intrigue when pitchers and catchers report to Surprise, Ariz., on Feb. 14.  The Rangers officially announced the signing of Guardado to a one-year contract on Friday, while Wright agreed to a Minor League contract with a non-roster invitation to Spring Training.  The Rangers are also close on a one-year contract with right-hander Jason Jennings, who would go into camp as a leading candidate to join the five-man starting rotation. That deal could be announced early next week. Guardado, 37, is a two-time All-Star closer who had 140 saves from 2002-05 -- including a league-leading 45 in 2002 -- and 183 in his career. Guardado said he is willing to do whatever the Rangers ask him, but made it clear -- just like Wilson has -- that he prefers to close.              T.R. Sullivan is a reporter for MLB.com.
