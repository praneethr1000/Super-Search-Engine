    "body": "MIAMI -- Dan Haren has informed the Marlins that his preference remains to pitch out West, and for a team that has Spring Training in Arizona. The 34-year-old California native had been weighing his options since he was traded to Miami from the Dodgers on Dec. 10. According to a source, Haren also told the Marlins that he was impressed with the direction the club was headed, but the right-hander is not planning on joining their rotation. If Miami cannot work out a trade, it is not clear yet if the 12-year big league veteran will retire. The Marlins were aware of Haren's intentions to pitch closer to home prior to including him in the seven-player trade with the Dodgers at the Winter Meetings in San Diego. In the blockbuster deal, Miami also acquired second baseman Dee Gordon and infielder Miguel Rojas for Andrew Heaney, Chris Hatcher, Enrique Hernandez and Austin Barnes. As part of the trade, the Dodgers agreed to pay the $10 million Haren is owed in 2015. The Marlins are still receiving a cash consideration from the Dodgers, believed to be $10 million -- even if the club is able to trade the right-hander. Haren went 13-11 with a 4.02 ERA in 32 starts for the Dodgers in 2014. Because of Haren's desire to pitch out West, trade options are limited for Miami. The only West division team that doesn't have Spring Training in Arizona is Houston, based in Kissimmee, Fla. It also is unclear if he would accept a move to a Central division club. In anticipation of Haren's decision, the Marlins made other moves to address their rotation. They acquired right-hander Mat Latos from the Reds for Anthony DeSclafani and Chad Wallach on Dec. 11. The team also worked out a five-player trade with the Yankees on Dec. 19, obtaining right-hander David Phelps and third baseman Martin Prado for Nathan Eovaldi, Garrett Jones and prospect Domingo German. Frontrunners for rotation spots are Latos, Henderson Alvarez, Jarred Cosart, Tom Koehler, Brad Hand and Phelps. Joe Frisaro is a reporter for MLB.com. He writes a blog, called The Fish Pond.
