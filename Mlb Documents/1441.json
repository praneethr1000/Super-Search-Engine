    "body": "Even before voters recorded the first shutout in a National Baseball Hall of Fame election since 1996, five members of the electorate were way ahead of the announcement in making a statement with silence.      For five voters from the Baseball Writers' Association of America, a blank ballot was the message to the baseball world, a message centered mainly on having to sit in judgment on a period clouded by the use of performance-enhancing drugs. With luminaries like Barry Bonds, Roger Clemens and Craig Biggio on the ballot for the first time, this year a blank ballot drew a lot more attention. Anyone who searched for \"blank ballot\" on Twitter could attest to that, with many people upset that any writer would submit one.                    Any writer who handed in a blank ballot for the baseball hall of fame voting should have their voting privileges revoked #DoYourJob   Every single person who either didn't return a @baseballhall ballot or who returned blank should be removed from process. #Truth #HallOfFame  For the record, the five blank ballots would not have made a difference. For instance, five more votes for Craig Biggio still would have left him 34 shy of the 427 needed to reach the 75 percent threshold. And five more votes for Bernie Williams or Kenny Lofton wouldn't have pushed them past the five percent threshold they needed to remain on the ballot.
