    "body": "ST. LOUIS -- A public visitation for Stan Musial is scheduled from 2-8 p.m. CT on Thursday at the Cathedral Basilica of St. Louis (4431 Lindell Boulevard). Two days later, Musial will be remembered during a private funeral mass at the same location.  Musial, a 22-year player with the Cardinals, died Saturday at the age of 92.  The archdiocese of St. Louis has asked that visitors enter the Cathedral Basilica from Lindell Boulevard. Photographs will not be permitted inside the church. Visitors are also asked not to leave mementos inside the Cathedral Basilica. The Stan Musial statue at Busch Stadium continues to serve as a memorial site for those wishing to leave something in Musial's memory. Saturday's private funeral service is scheduled to begin at 11 a.m. It will be followed by a funeral procession to Busch Stadium, where the family will place a wreath at the base of Musial's statue. Additional details regarding Saturday's procession route will be released later this week.   The Musial family has asked that fans wishing to send flowers instead make a donation to the Covenant House or charity of choice in Musial's name.  Jenifer Langosch is a reporter for MLB.com.
