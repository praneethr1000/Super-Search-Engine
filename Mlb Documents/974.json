    "body": "ANAHEIM -- Leading up to Spring Training, the Angels will once again host \"Moving Day\" at Angel Stadium, a free event that includes autograph sessions, prizes and games. This year's event will be held Thursday, Feb. 11, in the ballpark parking lot (beyond left field, near Tunnel B) from noon-2 p.m. PT. Angels legend Chuck Finley and current starting pitcher Tyler Skaggs will sign autographs and the organization will distribute raffle giveaways, including game-used items, autographed merchandise and a pair of Opening Day tickets. The Angels will also have a pitching machine and will host a question-and-answer session with FOX Sports West host Alex Curry and AM 830 KLAA host Roger Lodge. The event will take place just before the Angels' equipment truck makes the 365-mile drive east to the club's Spring Training complex in Tempe, Ariz., with pitchers and catchers slated to report eight days later. Old Dominion Household Services is acting as the presenting sponsor and AM 830 is slated to air the event live. Fans can use the hashtag #Road2Tempe on social-media platforms the day of the event for a chance to win tickets for a future game. Alden Gonzalez is a reporter for MLB.com.
