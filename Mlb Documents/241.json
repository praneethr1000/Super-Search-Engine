    "body": "CINCINNATI -- Former Reds general manager Dan O'Brien felt he had the right long-term plan to build the club's future. His biggest regret Tuesday was not getting a long enough term on the job to see it through.  After taking a day to collect his thoughts following his dismissal as GM by new owner Bob Castellini, O'Brien felt the club was headed in the right direction and that his legacy would likely emerge through the foundation he helped build with young players.  \"What's been accomplished to date will play an important role in the future success of this franchise,\" O'Brien said in a conference call with the media. \"The quality of the work that has been done will stand the test of time and validate the decisions that have been made.\" Mark Sheldon is a reporter for MLB.com.
