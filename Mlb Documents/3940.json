    "body": "Former Rockies closer Manny Corpas and top prospect Brett Jackson headlined a list of 21 non-roster players invited by the Cubs on Monday to participate in Major League Spring Training camp.  Corpas, 29, signed a one-year Major League deal with the Cubs in December, but was sent outright to Triple-A Iowa last week after Chicago re-signed reliever Kerry Wood. Corpas missed all of 2011 after undergoing Tommy John surgery on his right elbow the previous season, and inked a deal with the Cubs that includes a slew of incentives for appearances and days on the Major League roster. Corpas gets a $200,000 salary in the Minor Leagues and would earn $1,000,000 in the Majors, $200,000 of which is guaranteed. He would earn another $50,000 each for 50 and 55 games, $100,000 each for 60 and 65 games, $100,000 for 35 games finished, $150,000 for 40 games finished, $150,000 for 45 games finished, and $200,000 each for 50, 55 and 60 games finished. Corpas would also get $175,000 for spending each of 100, 120,140 and 160 days on the big league roster. Adam McCalvy is a reporter for MLB.com.
