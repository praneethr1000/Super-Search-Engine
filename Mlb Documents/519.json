    "body": "BOSTON -- No one ever said that trading for a starting center fielder who could double as your new leadoff hitter would be easy or cheap. But ask Red Sox general manager Theo Epstein about the time, effort and money spent to acquire Coco Crisp, and he'll tell you that it will all be worth it, and then some.  On Friday night, the Red Sox finally completed a deal with the Cleveland Indians that delivered the speedy and talented Crisp to Boston along with right-handed reliever David Riske and backup catcher Josh Bard.  In return, the Red Sox sent Cleveland top third base prospect Andy Marte, reliever Guillermo Mota and catching prospect Kelly Shoppach, along with a reported $1 million in cash considerations and a player to be named later or future cash considerations. On Saturday, Epstein, assistant GM Jed Hoyer and Crisp himself had the chance to finally talk about the much-anticipated trade.   \"I've got to give all the credit in the world to Jed and the rest of the guys in the office,\" Epstein said. \"The deal was obviously more than two or three days in the making. It was something that went on virtually the whole offseason, and we really have been tracking Coco Crisp for a year and a half now. Jed and [Indians assistant GM] Chris Antonetti probably set a new record for phone calls on the deal, probably making 100 phone calls back and forth, trying to get the deal to completion.   \"[Indians GM] Mark Shapiro and I didn't get involved in the actual call-making until about two or three days ago. It got a little bit complicated, obviously, in the last couple of days. Both front offices just had to get a little bit creative to reach a compromise that was fair for both sides,\" Epstein added.   Crisp, who is under Sox control for the next four seasons, comes to Boston realizing that he is replacing a very popular figure in Johnny Damon. But it's a job that he plans to embrace.   \"I'm a fan of the game, so I like a lot of the ballplayers, and Johnny's definitely one of them. As far as going into his shadow, I don't believe it's like that. I just want to step in there and play my own game. I think I've established myself slightly these last couple of years, and will continue to grow as a ballplayer and hopefully be able to bring some excitement and enjoyment to the game for the fans.\"   Epstein prefers to view his former and current center fielders as separate players with separate skills, putting aside any comparisons they may draw.   \"Coco Crisp is not Johnny Damon -- he is his own player,\" Epstein said. \"He brings his own strengths. Johnny was an outstanding, elite leadoff guy and center fielder for us for four years. It's unfair to ask Coco Crisp to fill those shoes. He's going to go and do it his own way.\"   Of all of the assets that Crisp brings with him, Epstein and Hoyer rate his ability to handle the unique pressure of playing day-to-day in Boston at or near the top of the list.   \"Everybody we talked to seems to think he would thrive in our environment. One thing we looked at that was important to us was how he played in the pennant race, and he was just an unbelievable player in September, when Cleveland was as hot as they were. Coco was fantastic down the stretch, and I think that meant a lot.\"   In 2005, Crisp batted .300 with 16 homers and 69 RBIs while swiping 15 bases, all career highs. Last year was the fourth straight season in which he had improved his batting average. Originally drafted by the St. Louis Cardinals in the seventh round in 1999, the Los Angeles native closed the season by batting .331 (40-for-121) with six homers, 16 RBIs and 18 runs in his final 29 games, beginning Sept. 2.   Crisp comes in with high hopes and great expectations.   \"Playing the last couple of years, I've gained more experience with Cleveland, trying to learn from the mistakes we made as a team that could help me out personally,\" Crisp said. \"With respect to the end of last year, just playing in those atmospheres, I learned a lot. I can't wait to be in that environment throughout the whole year. [In] pressure situations, I just sit back and relax, and there's nothing really to it. You just go out there and play your game, have fun and the rest will take care of itself.\"   Initial details of the trade surfaced last weekend, but the Indians had to juggle a deal with the Phillies simultaneously to make Friday's deal with Boston work. When Arthur Rhodes passed his physical on Friday, the Indians completed a deal to acquire outfielder Jason Michaels, thus clearing the way for Cleveland to send Crisp to Boston.      The 26-year-old switch-hitting Crisp, the key figure in the deal for the Red Sox, primarily played left field for the Indians last season because of the emergence of Grady Sizemore in center.   \"As far as Crisp playing center field, we're actually excited for him to play center,\" Epstein said. \"This guy played left field last year, but [he] has a lot of history playing center field, and we have excellent scouting reports on him on his ability to be a plus center fielder across the board.\"   Since breaking into the big leagues with the Indians at the age of 22 in 2002, Crisp has improved his batting average and total of home runs, doubles and runs scored in every season.   Acquired from the Cardinals in August 2002, Crisp has hit .287 with 90 doubles, 14 triples, 35 home runs, 176 RBIs, 235 runs and 54 stolen bases in 415 career Major League games with the Indians. Crisp, who throws right-handed, has appeared in 216 games (203 starts) in left field and 188 games (181 starts) in center field in his big-league career.   Joining Boston's already deep bullpen, the 29-year-old Riske was 3-4 in 2005, but posted an impressive 3.10 ERA in 72 2\/3 innings.   Riske has appeared in at least 58 games and logged more than 70 innings in each of the last three seasons, going 12-9 with 14 saves and a 3.04 ERA in 198 games over that span.   Drafted by the Indians in the 56th round in 1996, Riske is 17-12 with 16 saves and a 3.55 ERA in 287 career big-league games, all in relief. He worked on back-to-back days 10 times last season, going 2-0 with one save and a 1.42 ERA when pitching without a day of rest.   Riske figures to compete for a setup role in the middle of a Boston bullpen that already features Mike Timlin, Keith Foulke, Julian Tavarez, Lenny DiNardo and possibly Jonathan Papelbon.   \"Riske is a right-handed reliever with an excellent track record, a very consistent track record of success,\" Epstein said. \"He's got a very effective fastball. He's the type of guy we see fitting nicely into our bullpen.\"   The promising Bard will turn 28 on March 30. In 156 career games, Bard has 13 homers and 61 RBIs over parts of four seasons with the Tribe. Bard will join John Flaherty and Ken Huckaby as Spring Training candidates to back up Jason Varitek.   The switch-hitter hit .193 with a homer and nine RBIs in 34 games last season for Cleveland. Acquired from the Colorado Rockies in June 2001, the Texas Tech product has appeared in 149 games (133 starts) at catcher since breaking into the big leagues in 2002.   \"Josh Bard is a catcher with excellent defensive tools and someone ... whose best days are ahead of him,\" Epstein said. \"He's not coming off his best [offensive] season, but we still think there is some ceiling on him. He has outstanding makeup and calls a good game. [He's] a solid receiver with a plus arm, and he's going to be coming to camp with a chance to open some eyes.\" Mike Petraglia is a contributor to MLB.com.
