    "body": "ST. PETERSBURG -- The Devil Rays added to their infield depth Tuesday by signing free agent Ty Wigginton to a one-year deal.  Wigginton, who has played every infield position but shortstop, hit .258 with seven home runs and 25 RBIs in 155 at-bats with the Pirates in 2005. A right-handed hitter, Wigginton will make a nice complement to the Rays' corner positions, as both third baseman Sean Burroughs and first baseman Travis Lee both hit left-handed. Wigginton's will likely see time at first, third and designated hitter. Another upside of the deal is that the Rays can control Wigginton for three additional years through the arbitration process.  Wigginton, 28, owns a .262 career Major League average with 41 home runs and 180 RBIs over 403 games with the Mets and Pirates. Originally the Mets' 17th round selection in 1998, he was named to the 2003 Topps All-Rookie Team as he led all National League rookies in RBIs (71), extra-base hits (53) and doubles (36), and set Mets single-season rookie marks for hits (146), doubles, extra-base hits and at-bats (573).  Wigginton was acquired by the Pirates at the trading deadline in 2004 in a deal that sent right-hander Kris Benson to the Mets. He was Pittsburgh's Opening Day third baseman in 2005, but split the campaign between the Pirates and Triple-A Indianapolis. He hit .365 over his final 22 games with the Pirates following his return from Triple-A. Bill Chastain is a reporter for MLB.com.
