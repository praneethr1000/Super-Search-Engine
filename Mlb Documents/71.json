    "body": "BALTIMORE -- The Orioles did some housekeeping on Friday, when they designated Walter Young for assignment in order to make room on the 40-man roster for Kevin Millar. Baltimore will have 10 days to trade, release or assign Young to the Minor Leagues, and that last development can only happen if he clears waivers.  Young spent most of last season with Triple-A Ottawa, where he batted .288 with 13 home runs. He earned a late promotion to the parent club and hit .303 in 14 big-league games. The hefty left-handed hitter was expected to battle for playing time in Spring Training, but his window of opportunity was slammed shut by Baltimore's acquisitions of Millar and Jeff Conine.  If Young passes through waivers, he'll likely be assigned to Ottawa all over again. That way, he can still spend Spring Training with the team and still serve as a contingency plan if either Millar or Conine wind up injured during the season.
