    "body": "CHICAGO -- At the Cubs Convention, Ron Santo's wife, Vicki, his son, Ron Santo Jr., and former teammates Randy Hundley, Glenn Beckert and Billy Williams talked about the late third baseman, who was elected to the Hall of Fame in December. The Grand Ballroom was standing room only for the session. \"I know right now he's enjoying it,\" Williams said of Santo, who died in December 2010. \"He isn't clicking his heels -- he's pounding his fist.\" All agreed they were sad that the news came after Santo had passed. \"Ronnie would've been happier than anybody who's ever been elected to the Hall of Fame,\" said WGN Radio's Pat Hughes, who was Santo's partner for 15 years and the master of ceremonies of the session.  Vicki Santo will deliver the speech in honor of her husband in the induction ceremonies at Cooperstown on July 22.",
