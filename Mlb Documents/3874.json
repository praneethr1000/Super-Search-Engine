    "body": "Major League Baseball will collaborate with three other prominent global athletic organizations in a research initiative targeted at ending the use of banned and illegal substances in sports, it was announced Thursday.  The United States Olympic Committee, the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency and the National Football League join MLB in formation of the Partnership for Clean Competition, the initial mission of which will be to raise funds to underwrite scientific research into the detection and consequences of doping.  The announcement of the landmark joint effort came from the Colorado Springs offices of the U.S. Olympic Committee, whose chairman, Peter Ueberroth, hailed it as a significant step in the \"battle to protect and preserve the benefits of sport participation for the youth of our country.\" Joining the effort immediately as participants and financial contributors are such other major sports organizations as the National Basketball Association (NBA), National Hockey League (NHL) and Professional Golfers' Association of America (PGA). The PCC founders will stage an ongoing effort to raise additional funds and recruit other participants, from both the sport and non-sport sectors.",
