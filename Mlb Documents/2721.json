    "body": "MINNEAPOLIS -- The Twins agreed to terms with their sixth and final arbitration-eligible player on Saturday, as they signed left-handed reliever Brian Duensing to a one-year deal worth $2.7 million. The club confirmed the deal. After Minnesota couldn't come to an agreement with Duensing before the Jan. 16 deadline, the southpaw filed for $3.1 million and the club countered with $2.4 million. But the two sides were able to work out a deal to keep the Twins from going to an arbitration hearing for the ninth straight year. \"I'm just glad the process is over and we agreed,\" Duensing said. \"I love this organization and that I'm here, and we were able to get it done.\" Duensing, who turns 32 on Feb. 22, posted a 3.31 ERA in 54 1\/3 innings last year. It was the second-lowest ERA of his six-year career. He's the third-longest tenured Twins player behind Joe Mauer and Glen Perkins, and he's happy his contract situation is now settled. \"I'm excited it's over with and I don't have to think about it heading into Spring Training or anything,\" Duensing said. \"The last thing you need is something over your head. I'm more worried about staying healthy and learning under the new staff and meeting our new players.\" All of the club's arbitration-eligible players have now agreed to terms, as Trevor Plouffe, Eduardo Nunez, Casey Fien and Tommy Milone signed one-year deals on Feb. 16, while outfielder Jordan Schafer inked a one-year deal on Friday.
