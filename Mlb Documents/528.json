    "body": "CHICAGO -- Ozzie Guillen has a message for those fans who attend Saturday morning's Town Hall meeting at the Palmer House Hilton in Chicago on Day 2 of SoxFest 2009: Feel free to step up to the microphone and challenge the White Sox manager or general manager Ken Williams, both of whom will be on the dais with the radio broadcast team of Ed Farmer and Darrin Jackson at 10:30 a.m. CT. The talkative and charismatic Guillen enjoys more of the give-and-take in these question-and-answer sessions, even in strong disagreement with the organization's philosophy, more so than on Friday night's borderline White Sox appreciation night in the first of three weekend get-togethers.  \"I'm not disappointed, because when you win, you hear positive stuff,\" said Guillen, talking to a group of media members following Friday's hourlong session. \"But get in there and tell us how you feel. That's why we have these things going.\" Friday's Town Hall meeting featured a few dissenting opinions, although certainly not representative of anything really close to angry White Sox fans. Following an introduction featuring comments from Guillen, Williams and the television broadcast team of Ken \"Hawk\" Harrelson and Steve Stone, the first question dealt with the tough economical times as they relate to White Sox supporters and the team.   Williams pointed out how the directive from above has never changed for him since taking over the reins after the 2000 season. It definitely does not start or end with the idea of just turning a profit for the franchise.   \"Win, every year,\" said Williams of the directive, drawing applause from the crowd.   One fan took to task Greg Walker, who is not in attendance this weekend, focusing on the inability of the White Sox offense to handle soft-tossing pitchers or execute the fundamentals during the hard-working and knowledgeable Walker's 5 1\/2-year tenure as the team's hitting coach.  Guillen, in defense of his staff member and friend, quipped how it was interesting that Walker took the criticism for the 2008 offense's shortcomings but didn't get any credit for the emergence of such young standouts as Carlos Quentin and Alexei Ramirez.  Guillen also came up with the prediction of the year, even in late January, stating that Ramirez at shortstop will make people forget that Guillen ever played the position.   When another fan laid out his personal list of concerns, the same concerns that also should worry Guillen, the skipper countered with a wry smile and calmly commented that it's too early to make judgments.   \"I'm always concerned in January,\" he said. \"Talk to me in September.\"   A woman stepped to the microphone and reminded Williams that one of his 2008 Town Hall predictions was that Quentin jerseys would be very popular on the South Side of Chicago by June. She told Williams that he was wrong -- they were popular by the end of April.   When asked for a player to watch for in 2009, both Williams and Guillen talked about Josh Fields and his vastly improved defense through his offseason work with bench coach Joey Cora.   Guillen told the media moments later that Fields will enter Spring Training holding an edge at third base, with the job being his to lose. Guillen seemed excited by the Cactus League competition coming up between Jerry Owens, Brian Anderson and DeWayne Wise in center and Chris Getz, Brent Lillibridge and Jayson Nix at second.   \"It will be fun to watch guys compete,\" Guillen said. \"We'll be talking every day about someone, because every day is going to be important to these players.   \"Fans worry about name players not being at these positions, but I don't want names. I want guys who can play. And right now, I like this ballclub a lot.\"   Apparently, so did most of the fans attending Friday's \"Your 2009 White Sox\" in the Red Lacquer Room. They also expressed a clear, and even emotional, affinity for last year's American League Central champs and, of course, the lingering meaning of the 2005 World Series champions.   Of course, Guillen appreciated such appreciation. But he certainly wants the fans to speak their minds in the remaining two SoxFest seminars of this nature.   \"You hear 'Thank you' for 2005? That was 10 years ago,\" said Guillen with a laugh. \"There's no doubt 2005 was a great year, but I want people to ask what they want to ask.\"    Scott Merkin is a reporter for MLB.com.
