    "body": "SAN FRANCISCO -- Giants manager Bruce Bochy welcomed the disruption of his concentration as he awaited Game 4 of the National League Championship Series last Oct. 18. A St. Louis club official entered Bochy's office in the Busch Stadium visitors' clubhouse and informed him that Stan Musial, who is to the Cardinals what Willie Mays is to the Giants, would be honored before the game. Musial would be driven around the warning track in a golf cart, enabling fans everywhere in the ballpark to shower cheers upon \"The Man,\" who was a month away from turning 92. The official also had a surprise for Bochy from Musial himself. \"He said if you'd like, he'd like to say hello to you,\" Bochy said. \"Obviously, I was not going to miss that opportunity.\"           Chris Haft is a reporter for MLB.com.
