    "body": "The Pirates' annual pre-Spring Training voluntary workouts are under way at Pirate City. This year, the conclave is living up to one of its chief purposes, a greet-and-meet mixer for newcomers to the organization.  General manager Neal Huntington likes the gathering, open to players on the 40-man roster and invited others, because \"guys enjoy getting to know each other, and it's the first stage to turning the page [from the offseason] and getting everybody's baseball energies flowing again.\"  The \"getting to know\" part will be enhanced by various social outings after each morning's workouts, from Monday night's BCS championship game viewing party to golf and fishing junkets.
