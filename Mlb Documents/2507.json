    "body": "CLEVELAND -- From top to bottom, the Indians have undergone changes in the leadership structure of their farm system for the upcoming season. On Tuesday, Cleveland unveiled its staffing plans for the player development department, which includes a new Carolina League affiliate in Class A Advanced, the Lynchburg Hillcats. Mark Budzinski, who managed Class A Lake County last season, has been promoted to the same role with Lynchburg, which was added to the fold after the Indians and Carolina Mudcats parted ways. Budzinski's move to Lynchburg paved the way for Shaun Larkin -- Lake County's hitting coach last season -- to move into the Captains' managerial role. While the Indians have yet to anounce a hitting coach for Lynchburg, the club did name Tony Arnold its new pitching coach for the Hillcats after he filled the same role with Triple-A Columbus in the previous two seasons. Taking over as Columbus' pitching coach will be Carl Willis, who served as Cleveland's Major League pitching coach in the 2003-09 seasons. Willis held that same job with the Seattle Mariners' big league staff from 2010-13 before returning to the Indians as a special assistant to the baseball operations staff last year. Two more notable changes in the managerial structure include Scooter Tucker's move to the role of catching coordinator and Travis Fryman's return to managing with Class A short-season Mahoning Valley. Tucker served as a manager for Lake County (2013) and Carolina ('14) in the previous two years, while Fryman had worked as a special assistant and infield coordinator over the past four seasons. Fryman last managed Mahoning Valley in the 2008-10 seasons. Chris Tremie (third season) and Dave Wallace (second season) will return as the managers for Triple-A Columbus and Double-A Akron, respectively. Likewise, Anthony Medrano will renew his role as the manager of the Arizona League (Rookie level) Indians for a fifth season. The Indians announced earlier this offseason that Ross Atkins has been promoted to the role of vice president of player personnel. That opened the door for Carter Hawkins to take over for Atkins as Cleveland's director of player development. Eric Binder, who joined the baseball operations staff in 2013 as an intern, will assume Hawkins' former role as the assistant director of player development this year for the Tribe.
