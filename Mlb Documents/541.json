    "body": "ANAHEIM -- In spite of losing a man who led the American League in saves three of the past four seasons, setting a Major League record with 62 in 2008, the Angels are confident their bullpen can be as good as ever in 2009.  \"We have a lot of depth, a lot of options,\" manager Mike Scioscia said. \"We think we're in good shape down there.\"  Arm for arm, the reigning American League West champs might not deal it for any bullpen in the Majors. Life without Francisco Rodriguez, the Mets' new closer, clearly will be different, less predictable in format.   Southpaw Brian Fuentes, the Rockies' finisher the past four years, was signed as a free agent, but the three-time National League All-Star won't need to shoulder the ninth-inning burden alone.   In Scot Shields and 2008 rookie revelation Jose Arredondo, Scioscia has two other hammers capable of nailing down three outs -- or more, if necessary -- to carve out a save.   General manager Tony Reagins called it \"a safe assumption\" that Fuentes, 33, would inherit K-Rod's role as the club's primary closer.   \"Obviously, this strengthens our bullpen in a very significant way,\" Reagins said. \"Brian joining Jose, Scot Shields, [Justin] Speier and [Darren] Oliver should give us a good opportunity to close games.\"   Arredondo held opponents scoreless in 43 of 52 appearances, going 10-2 with a 1.62 ERA. Oliver, who has excelled in middle relief for two seasons, provides more left-handed balance in concert with Fuentes, while Speier is expected to rebound from a disappointing 2008.   Kevin Jepsen, Jason Bulger and Rich Thompson are in-house bullpen candidates who have shown impressive stuff in stints with the Angels.   Fuentes signed for $17.5 million for two years with a $9 million option for 2011 that kicks in if he finishes 55 games in '09. Rodriguez's deal with the Mets is for three years and $37 million with a $14 million option for 2012.   Fuentes, a Merced, Calif., native, made no secret of his desire to pitch for the Angels. He has saved at least 30 games in three of the past four seasons for the Rockies, producing 111 of his 115 career saves in the span.   His one down season -- he was 20-for-27 in save situations in 2007 -- happened to be the greatest year in franchise history, culminating in a World Series berth.   \"It's funny ... once you get there, all the bad seasons are washed away,\" Fuentes said. \"Obviously, it's not every year you get to the World Series, but the Angels are in the playoffs year in, year out. To have that opportunity is very appealing.     \"I'm very happy with how it worked out. Being in California, it's always nice to have that comfort zone.\"   He'll also find some comfort in familiar faces. Fuentes pitched alongside Speier and Oliver in Colorado and with Shields on Team USA in the inaugural World Baseball Classic in 2006.   Shields and Fuentes are on the provisional roster to wear the red, white and blue in the second version of the Classic in March.   A big man at 6-foot-4 and 230 pounds who pounds the strike zone with a 90 mph heater and rides a biting slider in on right-handers' hands, Fuentes is coming off perhaps his finest season.   He had 30 saves in 34 opportunities (.882 success rate) in 2008 with a career-best 2.73 ERA, including a 1.84 road ERA.   Left-handed hitters batted .184 against Fuentes in 2008 with a .226 on-base percentage and .245 slugging percentage. For his career, lefties are hitting .215 against him compared to .225 by right-handed hitters.   He has done that pitching half of his games in Coors Field, a notorious hitter's park compared to neutral Angel Stadium.   Fuentes' second half of 2008 was as dominant a stretch as he has enjoyed in his eight-year career. He didn't blow a save in 16 attempts with a 1.75 ERA, holding hitters to a .156 batting average with 45 strikeouts in 25 2\/3 innings.   \"I pitch better the more I pitch,\" he said.   Fuentes finished with 82 strikeouts against 22 walks in 62 2\/3 innings, holding hitters to a .205 batting average. K-Rod had 77 strikeouts and 34 walks in 68 1\/3 innings, limiting hitters to a .216 average.   For his career, Fuentes owns a saves success rate of .827, compared to K-Rod's .863.   With 31 holds in 2008, Shields led the AL for the third consecutive season. Remarkably durable, he began the season on the 15-day disabled list with tightness in his right forearm but finished strong with a 2.10 second-half ERA.   Shields' 2.70 ERA for the year was his best since 2002 when he broke through with the World Series champion Angels with 29 appearances, going 5-3 with a 2.20 ERA.   Arredondo, at 24, has the stuff and temperament to emerge as a premier closer. He struck out 55 in 61 innings, allowing 64 baserunners. He held hitters to a .190 batting average and .533 OPS (on-base plus slugging), superior to K-Rod's .630.   Oliver (7-1, 2.88, 72 innings) was rock solid. While Speier (2-8, 5.03, 68 innings) was damaged by the long ball (15 homers), he allowed just 25 percent of inherited runners to score. Only Shields (20 percent) was better among Angels relievers.   Jepsen, Bulger and Thompson fit Scioscia's preferred profile: power arms who can be tough to handle when they're pounding the strike zone. Lyle Spencer is a reporter for MLB.com.
