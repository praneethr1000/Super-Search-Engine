    "body": "CLEVELAND -- The Indians have spent this winter figuratively loading up their dugout with two-time World Series-winning manager Terry Francona and veteran outfielder Nick Swisher, among others. And on Thursday morning, it was time to literally load up the equipment for the annual rite of passage that is Truck Day. Two trucks departed Progressive Field at 11 a.m. ET, bound for Goodyear, Ariz. According to home clubhouse manager Tony Amato, the trucks are scheduled to arrive at the Tribe's Player Development Complex on Monday and unload on Tuesday. \"The clubhouse will be in operation by Tuesday night,\" Amato said.
