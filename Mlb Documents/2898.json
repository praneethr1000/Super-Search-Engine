    "body": "ANAHEIM -- The Angels' spring competition for bench spots is getting pretty interesting. On Wednesday, they were nearing agreement on a Minor League contract with Chad Tracy, the 33-year-old corner infielder who joins first baseman Carlos Pena, third baseman Ian Stewart, utility infielder John McDonald and outfielder Brennan Boesch among notable veterans fighting for one of three reserve roles in Spring Training. Tracy has posted a .274\/.333\/.439 slash line in nine years in the big leagues, with six of those seasons coming for a D-backs organization that previously employed Angels general manager Jerry Dipoto in its front office. With the Nationals the past two years, Tracy hit .230\/.286\/.374 with seven homers and 25 RBIs in 165 games. McDonald is expected to compete with Andrew Romine, Tommy Field and Shawn O'Malley for the utility infield spot. For potential lefty bats off the bench, the Angels currently have outfielder J.B. Shuck, Tracy, Stewart, Pena and Boesch. Infielder Grant Green and outfielder Collin Cowgill are also in the mix. Of those competing for bench spots, only Romine and Minor League catcher John Hester must go through waivers before being optioned to the Minor Leagues, giving the Angels the roster flexibility they've been working for all offseason.
