    "body": "ARLINGTON -- In a 48-hour period, at a time when the Rangers were supposed to be celebrating the signing of pitcher Yu Darvish, everybody from co-owner Bob Simpson to assistant general manager Thad Levine were asked about free agent first baseman Prince Fielder.  General manager Jon Daniels was first to the plate in that ballgame, saying last Wednesday night that it was \"very unlikely\" that the Rangers will be involved in what happens with Fielder. Daniels based his prediction on the Rangers' current budget and Simpson confirmed to multiple outlets on Friday that the club is indeed operating at a deficit. Simpson also suggested the Rangers are and will continue to operate at a deficit until the new television contract begins in 2015.  But Fielder is still a free agent and Daniels' statement hardly sated the inquisitive. The question was simply passed along to others and there is still a strong belief in some quarters that he will end up being with the Rangers. That belief remains viral because the Rangers allow it to remain alive even while they remain \"actively engaged\" in contract extension discussions with All-Star outfielder Josh Hamilton. T.R.
