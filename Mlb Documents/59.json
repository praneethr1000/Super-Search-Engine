    "body": "BOSTON -- Spending his first days in Boston this week, culture shock has yet to set in for Josh Beckett, a lifetime Florida Marlin until the Thanksgiving Day blockbuster trade that saw him become a member of the Red Sox. There he was Wednesday night, walking around the streets of Boston wearing shorts.  \"It was 61 degrees,\" said Beckett. \"I was quite surprised. I was actually walking around in shorts and people were looking at me like I was weird and asking me where I was from.\"  Beckett will likely long for those days of relative anonymity by April, when he will be at the virtual epicenter of Red Sox Nation and, as the saying goes on the theme song of Cheers, he'll be in the place where \"everybody knows your name.\" The hard-throwing right-hander was on hand for Thursday's Boston Baseball Writers Awards dinner, where he made his first public appearance in his new baseball home.   He also spent time at Fenway Park earlier in the week and chatted up manager Terry Francona in the trainers' room.   \"Yeah, he was icing his knee and we just sat and talked a little bit,\" said Beckett. \"It was nice. We had a good talk.\"   But Beckett has come to Boston to pitch, not talk, and he looks forward to getting that process started.   And what about the shoulder that was stiff at the end of last season and discussed so much when the Marlins and Red Sox were embarking on the trade?   \"You know what? I'm very pleased,\" said Beckett. \"I actually feel better this offseason than I did when I threw last year. I kind of attribute that to the fact that I was throwing the football almost immediately when I got home this year and kept it loose and everything like that.\"   And he made some fairly significant adjustments to his throwing program this winter.   \"I threw 14 bullpens last year. Our pitching coach down in Florida [Mark Wiley] was really adamant about the program he had all his pitchers on,\" Beckett said. \"We threw a lot. Then coming into Spring Training, we ended up on a four-man rotation until basically the last week of Spring Training. Last year, I did a lot of throwing in the offseason, in fact twice as much as I'm going to do this year.   \"I just think I peaked a little too soon last year. My first start of Spring Training last year, I threw five innings ... we were on a four-man rotation. [Francona] said it's going to be a little bit different here. We'll be busy, but we're not going to have a four-man rotation or anything like that. We'll be ready for April.\"   And in case you were wondering if a controversy will develop over who should be labeled the ace, it won't come from Beckett.   \"I'm looking forward to learning from [Curt] Schilling. I don't really consider myself in his class yet,\" said Beckett. \"I'm looking forward to just picking his brain; it's going to be nice. Where I'm coming from, it's always been a bunch of young guys. 'Here's the ball, just go out and try to throw it by everybody.' It's going to be fun. Finally, last year I had Al Leiter for half a season. I learned so much just in half a season with him. It's going to be fun talking to another guy of that caliber.\"   One thing Beckett and Schilling have in common? They've both been named MVP in the World Series. Beckett won that prized trophy conquering the Yankees in 2003, while Schilling shared MVP honors with Randy Johnson in 2001, also over New York.   But Beckett, who just last year posted a career-high 15 wins, marvels at how Schilling has been able to do it for so long.   \"Just the innings, being a horse. Those are the things I need to learn,\" said Beckett.   Of course, Beckett has already earned the respect of those hitters he has mowed down over the years.   \"I thought he was the best pitcher in the National League, to be honest with you,\" said Mark Loretta, Boston's new second baseman. \"He got me out a lot. I'm glad he's on my team now.\"   Beckett, a low key guy who is known for his intensity on game day, hopes to avoid the trap that many players fall into when they move from a small market to a big market.   \"All I'm trying to do is execute quality pitches successfully,\" Beckett said. \"I think if I can do that like I did or have done in the last few years, I think I'll still be able to get outs. I'm not worried too much about the pressure.\" Ian Browne is a reporter for MLB.com. This story was not subject to the approval of Major League Baseball or its clubs.",
