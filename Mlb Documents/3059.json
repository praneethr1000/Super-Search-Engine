    "body": "MILWAUKEE -- Brewers catcher Jonathan Lucroy offered a vigorous defense of teammate Ryan Braun during an appearance on the team's flagship radio station Thursday night, telling 620-AM WTMJ that he would be, \"very, very, very shocked\" if Braun knowingly cheated Major League Baseball's rules against banned substances.  Braun currently faces the prospect of a 50-game suspension under MLB's Joint Drug Prevention and Treatment Program and is reportedly appealing.  \"I feel for him, I really do,\" Lucroy said. \"Let me tell you something for everybody that's listening: I've seen this guy in the weight room every single day work his butt off. There is no one on this team that works as hard as he does. ... I've never witnessed him do anything that I would think or anyone else would think is illegal. I honestly think it was some kind of screw-up. I don't know what happened. I would be very, very, very shocked if he actually took something knowingly. This guy is way too smart to do something like that. Adam McCalvy is a reporter for MLB.com. Read his blog, Brew Beat, and follow him on Twitter at @AdamMcCalvy.
