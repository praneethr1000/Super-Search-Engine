    "body": "BALTIMORE -- The Orioles have claimed catcher Luis Martinez off waivers from the Texas Rangers, the club announced on Friday.  Martinez, 27, is a career .272\/.362\/.364 hitter in six Minor League seasons in the San Diego Padres' (2007-11) and Rangers' (2012) systems. Last year for Triple-A Round Rock, Martinez batted .270\/.350\/.386 in 65 games, and he also appeared in 10 big league games, going 2-for-18. He was selected by the Padres in the 12th round of the 2007 First-Year Player Draft.  The move puts the Orioles' 40-man roster at capacity and gives the organization four catchers: Matt Wieters, Taylor Teagarden, Luis Exposito and Martinez. Martinez, along with all members of the 40-man roster, will be in big league camp. Brittany Ghiroli is a reporter for MLB.com.
