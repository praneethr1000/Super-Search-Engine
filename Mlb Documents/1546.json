    "body": "ARLINGTON -- Rangers outfielder Engel Beltre and infielder Jurickson Profar both have dreams of being in the big leagues.  Beltre believes that path runs through the World Baseball Classic. Profar isn't as sure, and he is undecided about playing for the Netherlands in the tournament this spring.  \"I don't know yet, I'm thinking about it,\" Profar said. \"Maybe I have a chance to make the [Rangers]. That's why I'm thinking about it; see where I'm at and what's going to happen.\" Profar likes the idea of \"playing with my friends that I grew up with and representing my country ... and it's good competition.\"      Spring Training would give Profar a chance to change the Rangers' minds. Andrus is playing for Venezuela and Adrian Beltre is playing for the Dominican Republic in the Classic. Both will be away for several weeks at least, which would allow Profar to get significant playing time in Cactus League games and show the club what he can do.              T.R.
