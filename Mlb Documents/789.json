    "body": "MIAMI -- With Alex Gordon now off the market, teams looking for outfield help are starting to contact the Marlins about Marcell Ozuna. Miami, according to a source, is \"listening\" but has no urgency to deal the 25-year-old unless it receives a substantial return, which most likely would include a starting pitcher. â€¢ Hot Stove Tracker The outfield market shifted on Wednesday with Gordon returning to the Royals on a reported four-year, $72 million contract. Justin Upton and Yoenis Cespedes are free agents who will command high salaries, and Ozuna, who isn't eligible for free agency until 2020, is a more affordable option. The cost for Ozuna from another club would be big league-ready talent and prospects. Yahoo Sports reported on Wednesday that the market on Ozuna is \"moving fast,\" including one team from the West Coast. And Bob Nightengale of USA Today reports the Rangers are holding \"trade discussions\" with Miami. Ozuna, a year away from being arbitration-eligible, has been the subject of trade speculation since last July, after he was demoted to Triple-A New Orleans and fell out of favor with team owner Jeffrey Loria. At the Winter Meetings, roughly 10 teams expressed some level of interest in Ozuna, who hit 10 homers and drove in 44 runs last year. Ozuna is a right-handed-hitting power threat, who belted 23 home runs and drove in 85 runs in 2014. If Ozuna is dealt, the Marlins are prepared to move Christian Yelich, a Gold Glove Award-winning left fielder in 2014, to center field. Left-handed-hitting Derek Dietrich would be the front-runner to play left field, with a right-handed-hitting platoon option. Joe Frisaro is a reporter for MLB.com.
