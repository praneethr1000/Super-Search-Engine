    "body": "MINNEAPOLIS -- Testing his newly brace-free knee at TwinsFest was the last thing that Jason Kubel had planned on doing.  Just weeks after getting clearance to practice freely without the constraint of the brace, though, Kubel did just that as he took a little tumble off the stage at the annual event. And as luck would have it, Kubel landed squarely on the rehabilitated knee.  \"I was trying to walk around [Rob] Bowen on the stage, and ended up taking a fall right onto my bad knee,\" Kubel said. \"It was a bit of a scare, but once I knew it was all right, I was able to breathe easy.\" Kelly Thesier  is a reporter for MLB.com.
