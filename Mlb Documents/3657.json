    "body": "The Arizona Diamondbacks are holding their seventh annual Fantasy Camp this week at their Spring Training complex in Scottsdale, Ariz. Josh Greene, the D-backs' publications director, is taking part in his first camp and will be writing a daily recap of his experiences. Tradition is not only alive and well in Major League Baseball, it's also in full effect at fantasy camp for the D-backs.  Before hitting the practice fields every morning, the long-honored staple known as kangaroo court goes into session. Presided over by the honorable Mark Grace, who serves as both judge and jury while sporting a robe and old-school powdered wig, it's a time for the airing of grievances among campers and staff. Fines of a few dollars are levied for each offense, and shame is pretty much a guarantee. The other former D-backs players in attendance are certainly not immune to Judge Gracie's judicial whims. Favorite target Luis Gonzalez spends much of each session being teased about his prowess with autographs and his new energy drink. This week, Steve Finley took heat for not fielding his position as a game pitcher, but most of the runs are aimed at the campers themselves.  Uniform infractions (including wearing too flashy of shoes or the wrong jersey) are a big no-no, as are isolated incidents like wearing your batting helmet out onto the field or mistakenly forgetting your team and joining up with one that is wearing your same-colored jersey. Getting caught looking for autographs is also frowned upon, evidently, as one camper who secured a good portion of them from the returning 2011 squad quickly found out. Mess up, and chances are somebody saw it and is reporting it -- all in good fun, of course.   One of the most popular traditions is the nightly sessions with the D-backs' staff at the camp hotel. Consider it an uncensored question-and-answer period where a rotating group of alumni answer any and all questions from campers. Since there is no filter, it's truly anything goes in terms of content, but that's also why it's so entertaining.   Among some of the printable nuggets of info picked up: Gracie's disdain for working extra-inning games, Gonzo being convinced filling in for Gracie on Game of the Week telecasts has been solely dependent on whether it was a city Gracie did or didn't want to visit. And nobody has any qualms about sharing their honest opinion of rival teams in the Majors.   As a thank you to the respective team managers, on Wednesday nights, it is customary for their squads to treat them to dinner. Team Williams\/Sherlock reconvened at a nearby restaurant to not only cover the bill, but also get a chance to interact with their managers in a more personal and low-key environment. From manager to camper, it's an interesting chance for everybody to see a different side of each other off the field. Both Matt Williams and Glenn Sherlock seem to relish getting to know the campers, too -- as much as they enjoy getting a chance to stick it to their fellow instructors (and former D-backs teammates) on the field.   One of the first things Williams stressed to us this week was that \"in baseball, perfection is impossible, but the pursuit of it is imperative.\"   We must be doing something right. Team Williams\/Sherlock ended Wednesday with a 3-0 record heading into the camp's final doubleheader slated for Thursday. Josh Greene is director of publications for the Arizona Diamondbacks.
