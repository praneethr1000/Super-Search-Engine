    "body": "Move over, Class of 2013. The next group of players eligible for the first time to be elected into the National Baseball Hall of Fame is on its way, and it, too, is loaded with talent.  After a shutout of an election with awe-inspiring career achievements and spirited debate surrounding the first-timers on the ballot, the Class of 2014 will bring with it some serious credentials to further deepen what will remain a heavily-stocked ballot next time around. Ace pitchers Greg Maddux and Tom Glavine join with slugger Frank Thomas to lead a group of newcomers that is thick with the types of accomplishments of which Hall of Famers are made.        In fact, longtime Braves manager Bobby Cox and GM John Schuerholz also are up for consideration by the Veterans Committee and could be headed for induction as well. \"That would truly be something,\" Cox said. \"I've always said, I just want to be there when Maddux, Glavine, Smoltz and all of those guys get in.\"        John Schlegel is a national reporter for MLB.com.
