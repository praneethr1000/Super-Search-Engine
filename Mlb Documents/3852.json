    "body": "TORONTO -- The Blue Jays continued to add pitching depth on Monday, signing right-hander Shawn Camp to a Minor League contract with an invitation to Spring Training.  The 32-year-old Camp pitched for the Tampa Bay Rays over the past two seasons. Last year, he went 0-3 with a 7.20 ERA in 50 games out of Tampa Bay's bullpen. Camp has spent parts of four seasons in the big leagues, going 10-13 with a 5.27 career ERA in 196 games between stints with the Rays and Kansas City Royals.  On Wednesday, Toronto signed pitchers Lance Carter, John Parrish and Ryan Ketchner to Minor League deals and extended Spring Training invites to each player. The four pitchers, including Camp, don't currently project to be in Toronto's bullpen, but could provide depth in the Minors. Jordan Bastian is a reporter for MLB.com.
