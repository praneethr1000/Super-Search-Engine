    "body": "In many ways, 2010 represented a breakout season for Mets outfielder Angel Pagan. On Tuesday at 12 p.m. ET on mets.com, Pagan will interact with fans in a live chat to answer questions about his preparation for the upcoming season, his outlook on the Mets in 2011 and more. In addition to being able to submit questions on mets.com, fans can also send questions via Twitter using the hashtag #askAngel.  In a career-high 633 plate appearances last year, Pagan hit .290 with 11 homers and 69 RBIs. His work on the basepaths was also noteworthy, with 37 stolen bases to his credit in his first full season as an everyday Major Leaguer. Pagan also proved to be a valuable and versatile defensive asset. Primarily playing as a center fielder, Pagan registered a .987 fielding percentage.   This season, the Mets will look to Pagan to reprise his impressive 2010 campaign, likely in a similar role as a tablesetter near the top of the lineup. Bailey Stephens is a reporter for MLB.com.
