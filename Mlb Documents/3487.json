    "body": "BALTIMORE -- The Orioles remain in talks with free-agent pitcher Armando Galarraga, although reports that the sides have reached an agreement are premature.  According to a baseball source, Galarraga has not signed a Minor League contract with Baltimore or any other organization. Multiple Venezuelan reports and the transaction page of CBS Sports both had the deal completed, and while there is still a good chance that something will get done, nothing is official.  The 30-year-old Galarraga, who would likely receive an invite to Major League camp if signed, went 3-4 with a 5.91 ERA in eight starts for Arizona last season. Acquired in a January 2011 trade with Detroit, he made five starts for Triple-A Reno, posting a 9.26 ERA in 23 1\/3 innings. Galarraga is best known for pitching a near-perfect game for the Tigers in 2010, only to lose it when umpire Jim Joyce blew a call at first base with two out in the ninth inning.
