    "body": "CLEVELAND -- Perhaps the whole will be greater than the sum of its parts. That's general manager Mark Shapiro's line of thinking when it comes to first base. The Indians' first-base duties will be handled by platoon, as the club signed free agent Eduardo Perez to a one-year deal with a club option for 2007 on Thursday. Financial terms of the deal were not released. The 6-foot-4, 215-pound Perez, a first-round draft pick by the Angels in 1991, had his best season in 1997 with the Reds. He batted .253 with 16 homers and 52 RBIs that year.        Anthony Castrovince is a reporter for MLB.com. This story was not subject to the approval of Major League Baseball or its clubs.",
