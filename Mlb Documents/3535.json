    "body": "MILWAUKEE -- Right-hander Wily Peralta is the Brewers' top prospect and the 49th best prospect in baseball, according to a MLB.com list unveiled Wednesday night.  Peralta and left-hander Jed Bradley (ranked 97th) are the only Brewers farmhands to make the Top 100 Prospects list. The list, which is one of several prospect rankings on MLB.com's Prospect Watch, only includes players with rookie status in 2012. This year's edition of MLB.com's Top Prospects list has expanded from 50 to 100 players. The annual ranking of baseball's biggest and brightest young talent is assembled by MLB.com's Draft and prospect expert Jonathan Mayo, who compiles input from industry sources, including scouts and scouting directors. It is based on analysis of players' skill sets, upsides, proximity to the Majors and potential immediate impact to their teams. It was a welcome bounce-back after Peralta fizzled in a spring bid for the Brewers' fifth-starter slot. The team had an opening after Zack Greinke cracked a rib and fellow prospect Mark Rogers had a setback with his surgically-repaired shoulder. But handed the opportunity, Peralta struggled with command in Cactus League starts. He allowed five earned runs on five hits and two walks while recording only one out in his final outing against the Rockies and was optioned to the Minors on March 25.
