    "body": "The Roger Clemens public relations campaign is in high gear, with The Rocket being cast as the innocent who has been grievously wronged.  We were all probably happier when Clemens' role was the more straightforward one; simply one of the greatest pitchers of this generation or any other. But when his former personal trainer, Brian McNamee, alleged in the Mitchell Report that he had injected Clemens with steroids and human growth hormone at least 16 times, the public frame of reference for the big guy changed dramatically.  This was why you saw Clemens being interviewed on \"60 Minutes\" by Mike Wallace on Sunday night, and then meeting the media again on Monday afternoon. For further ammunition, Clemens' attorneys have a filed a defamation lawsuit against McNamee. The centerpiece of the Monday press conference in Houston was the playing of a 17-minute telephone conversation between Clemens and McNamee. The tape of the conversation was given a considerable buildup by Clemens' lead attorney, Rusty Hardin, but it turned out to be far from definitive.   On the tape, McNamee came across as being very sorry that he had caused his old pal, The Rocket, so much trouble. And McNamee also was obviously deeply concerned about serious health issues confronting his own 10-year-old son. But at no point during this conversation did McNamee come close to recanting his testimony to federal authorities and the Mitchell Report investigators. It is true that McNamee did not accuse Clemens of lying, but he also did not admit that he had lied. There was no smoking gun, no bolt of lightning, no ultra-dramatic revelation to be found in this conversation.   In the larger context, what we are looking at here as a public relations strategy is a frontal assault by someone who assumes that he is the bigger, and better, man. It is fairly clear that Clemens and his handlers believe that he is obviously a much bigger cultural figure than McNamee, and thus, ultimately much more credible in the court of public opinion.   That's not a radical premise, but this case may not be quite that simple. And Clemens seems to sense that much.   \"I don't know if I can defend myself,\" Clemens told Wallace. \"I think a lot of people have already made their decision. And that's our country, isn't it? Guilty before innocent. That's the way our country works now.\"   Those are embittered words, largely condemning not just McNamee, but an entire society. A part of Clemens seems to believe that he has earned the right to be above this sort of thing.     \"I don't get the benefit of the doubt,\" Clemens said in the Wallace interview. \"The stuff that's being said, it's ridiculous, it's hogwash, for people to even assume this. Twenty-four, 25 years, Mike, you'd think I'd get an inch of respect. An inch.\"   The \"60 Minutes\" segment was an interesting matchup of two men, both well beyond their professional primes. Wallace, once one of the most feared interviewers in the business, here conducted a very gentle, even overtly sympathetic interrogation. Maybe even reputable television journalists should have a mandatory retirement age.   The new information that came from this session was Clemens' acknowledgement that McNamee had injected him, but only with vitamin B12 and the painkiller lidocaine. There is some question about the use of lidocaine, which is typically administered as a local anesthetic, being taken through a shot in the posterior. It would apparently work best in that case if you literally had a pain in the posterior.   But Clemens has at least two larger problems with his credibility relative to that of McNamee. One is that McNamee alleged in the Mitchell Report that he administered human growth hormone to Clemens' close friend and teammate, Andy Pettitte. Pettitte subsequently admitted that these allegations were precisely true, thus bolstering McNamee's credibility.   And Clemens had the same opportunity that every other player named in the Mitchell Report had, which was to answer the allegations directly, to get his side of the story told, before the report was finalized.   \"I was advised not to,\" Clemens told Wallace. \"If I had known what this man, Brian McNamee, said in this report, I would have been down there in a heartbeat to take care of it.\"   If he had been \"down there\" in a heartbeat, the coverage of his portion of the Mitchell Report would have been 50-50 instead of 95-5 in favor of the material contained in the report, which was all McNamee and no Clemens.   But the way it is, The Rocket, winner of 354 Major League games, is in the unfamiliar and uncomfortable position of playing catchup ball.   His session with the media on Monday didn't hurt his cause, but it probably wasn't a breakthrough for his cause, either. His general demeanor could be characterized as testy, which might have been understandable, but didn't make him into anything more of a sympathetic character.   This is new ground for Roger Clemens, who has basically been on top of a sport for more than two decades, but now must plead his case before the American public. He has had no experience as a public supplicant, and he doesn't seem particularly happy with having to undergo this experience.   But this is far from over. On deck, an appearance next week before a Congressional committee. \"I'm going to Congress and I'm going to tell the truth,\" Clemens said on Monday.   That's a good plan, but the issue of the public's perception of where the truth rests in this case remains far from resolved. Mike Bauman is a national columnist for MLB.com.
