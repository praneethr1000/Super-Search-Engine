    "body": "The Braves made official a trio of free-agent signings on Wednesday afternoon, announcing the additions of relievers Jason Grilli and Josh Outman and catcher A.J. Pierzynski. Grilli signed a two-year, $8.25 million deal with a $3 million club option for 2017. After a career year as the Pirates' closer in 2013 -- 2.70 ERA, 33 saves -- the 38-year-old right-hander struggled through his first 22 appearances last season, posting a 4.87 ERA before eventually being traded to the Angels in late June. With Los Angeles, Grilli had a 3.87 ERA in 40 games. Pierzynski, 38, is joining his seventh big league club and entering his 18th season in the Majors. He was released by the Red Sox last July and finished the season with St. Louis, hitting .251 with five homers and 37 RBIs on the year. The two-time All-Star selection signed a one-year contract with Atlanta. Outman also inked a one-year deal, and he will be entering his eighth Major League season. The 30-year-old lefty went 4-0 with a 2.86 ERA through 40 relief appearances last year with the Indians and the Yankees. Chad Thornburg is a reporter for MLB.com.
