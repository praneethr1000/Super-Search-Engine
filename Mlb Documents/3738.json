    "body": "ST. LOUIS -- Sounding unconcerned about the arm fatigue that plagued him late last season, Kyle McClellan has prioritized rest as he prepares for the 2012 season.  By design, McClellan has not begun throwing, though that part of his program is kicking off on Monday. He has ample time to get his arm stretched out before the start of Grapefruit League season and has maintained his shoulder exercises even while resting. McClellan leaves for Florida later this week.  No one can know for sure how McClellan's arm will respond after throwing a career-high 141 2\/3 innings in 2011. It is expected, however, that McClellan will not shoulder nearly as heavy a load in 2012, given what rotation pieces already in place. McClellan is projected to begin the year in the bullpen, which is where he made 26 of his 43 appearances last year. \"I think that's what makes me valuable. I can do a lot of different things,\" McClellan said. \"There are not a lot of guys who can say that. The season never goes as planned. There is always something that is going to pop up. I take a lot of pride in the fact that I can help our team bridge a gap.\"   McClellan, who has heard his name floated as a possible trade candidate for much of the offseason, also has the task of finalizing a contract with the Cardinals before Spring Training begins. One of the organization's two unsigned arbitration-eligible players, McClellan and the Cardinals are on track for a February arbitration hearing if no agreement is made beforehand.   McClellan avoided an arbitration hearing last year by agreeing to a $1.375 million deal in mid-January. He had little to say on the subject of his contract status on Monday.   \"From what I understand,\" he said, \"we still have plenty of time to get that done.\"",
