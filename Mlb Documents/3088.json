    "body": "CHICAGO -- Carlos Zambrano and Ozzie Guillen have teamed together to do commercials in their native Venezuela and charity events in Chicago, and are good friends. They're likely to be together on the Marlins as soon as Thursday.  According to a source, the Cubs and Marlins are expected to finalize by Thursday a trade that would send Zambrano to Miami. FOXSports.com's Ken Rosenthal reported that the Cubs would pay between $15 million and $16 million of the $18 million that Zambrano is owed next year.  CBS Sports' Jon Heyman also reported the Marlins were close to acquiring Zambrano and that Chris Volstad could go to the Cubs in exchange. ESPN Deportes' Enrique Rojas also reported a Zambrano-Volstad deal. Cubs and Marlins officials have yet to publicly comment on the reports.   If the Cubs do move Zambrano, it would end a tumultuous career in Chicago for the right-hander, good enough to throw a no-hitter in 2008, but also frustrating because of his antics.                 Volstad, 25, was 5-13 with a 4.89 ERA in 29 starts last season with the Marlins, striking out 117 over 165 2\/3 innings. In 103 games over four seasons in Florida, he was 32-39 with a 4.59 ERA. Volstad earned $445,000 last season; he will not be a free agent until after the 2014 season. Carrie Muskat is a reporter for MLB.com.
