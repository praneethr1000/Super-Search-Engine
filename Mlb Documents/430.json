    "body": "CHICAGO -- The Chicago Cubs' management is very aware of how bad the 2005 season was. On Saturday at the Cubs Convention, team president Andy MacPhail listed several negative statistics to a small crowd in the Boulevard Room at the Hilton Chicago. You had to wonder how the Cubs won any games at all.  MacPhail pointed out that the Cubs led the National League in hits in 2005 but ranked 29th out of 30 teams with runners in scoring position. That seems almost impossible.  The Cubs' outfielders ranked 30th in production in the Major Leagues. The leadoff men combined were 29th in on-base percentage. The Cubs' relievers issued the most walks and the most home runs. Kerry Wood, Mark Prior, Aramis Ramirez and Nomar Garciaparra spent 296 days combined on the disabled list. \"We had a bad year and I should've done a better job myself,\" Cubs general manager Jim Hendry told a packed Continental Ballroom crowd during a question-and-answer session with manager Dusty Baker.   During one fan's rant, he told Hendry and Baker he was tired of being razzed by his friends who are White Sox supporters, and that their winning the World Series made him sick.   \"I'm really unhappy with you, Jim,\" the fan said.   \"I appreciate your comments,\" Hendry said. \"We went about our business [this offseason] to address our needs.\"   That included signing experienced bullpen pitchers Scott Eyre and Bob Howry, trading for premier leadoff hitter Juan Pierre and signing Jacque Jones and John Mabry. Hendry said the payroll now is over $90 million, and it likely will reach $100 million after figuring in the increased salaries of arbitration-eligible players like Carlos Zambrano, Prior, Jerry Hairston and Pierre.   \"I don't think you can do better than Juan Pierre,\" Hendry said. \"And Willie Mays wasn't available for right.\"   The Cubs don't need to spend more money, Hendry said.   \"At a $100 million payroll, you're more than capable of winning,\" he said. \"We've got to get the job done.\"   Fans unhappy with the addition of Jones should know he's working with eight-time batting champ Tony Gwynn in San Diego. Hendry defended the move, saying it was better to sign Jones than deal three more top Minor Leaguers to get another player. Adding Pierre cost the Cubs three Minor League pitchers, including highly-regarded Ricky Nolasco.   But Hendry did clarify that no one in the Cubs' organization is untouchable.   \"If there's a deal to be made that makes the Cubs better, that's what we'll do,\" he said. \"We're in the job to win.\"   Asked if Wood would be in the bullpen or the rotation, Baker said the goal is to get the right-hander back in the rotation. However, Wood may have to make some relief outings to build up arm strength.   \"[Being a reliever] is an option,\" Baker said. \"We have Woody slated as a starter. But if his endurance isn't up and he's throwing good and he's ready, [then pitching out of the bullpen] might be another way. That's just an option.   \"We want him starting,\" Baker said. \"What if he's not ready to go seven [innings]? This could be the opposite of [Ryan] Dempster last year, where his arm strength was built up starting and he ended up being better in the 'pen.\"   Asked why the Cubs' brass was discussing contract extensions after a disappointing season, which has been reported in Chicago newspapers, both Baker and Hendry said they were not the ones talking about extensions. Both are in the final year of their contracts.   During a question-and-answer session with Baker and his coaching staff in the Grand Ballroom, a young girl asked why the Cubs had traded Corey Patterson.   \"Sometimes a change of scenery is necessary,\" Baker said of the young outfielder, who was dealt to the Baltimore Orioles.   The girl also wanted to know why there weren't any fireworks after home runs hit at Wrigley Field.   \"I'm not really in charge of that department,\" Baker said. \"This isn't Sox park.\"   And the large crowd cheered.
