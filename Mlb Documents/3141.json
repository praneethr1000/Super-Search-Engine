    "body": "MILWAUKEE -- Brewers general manager Doug Melvin said the club entered the New Year with no word about the status of outfielder Ryan Braun, who faces a 50-game suspension under Major League Baseball's Joint Drug Prevention & Treatment Program. If a date has been set for Braun to appeal, the club has not been informed about it.  \"We're not involved with it. We can't do anything about it,\" Melvin said. \"Everything comes from the Commissioner's Office.\"  That's the biggest Brewers story to watch in the early part of 2012.
