    "body": "SAN FRANCISCO -- Following the schedule the Giants prescribed, catcher Buster Posey has added running to his workout regimen as he continues efforts to heal his left leg in time for the 2012 season. Head athletic trainer Dave Groeschner said Monday that Posey mixed 30- and 60-yard sprints, agility drills and mild distance running into his routine three times per week after the new year began. Posey sustained torn ligaments in his ankle and a fractured bone in his lower leg in a home-plate collision with Florida's Scott Cousins last May 25. The injuries limited Posey to 45 games and ended his season. The Giants are counting on the 2010 National League Rookie of the Year to return healthy and, in doing so, help rouse the team's somnolent offense. Posey had a 13-game hitting streak when he was sidelined. \"We're just building him up right now. So far, so good,\" Groeschner said.     \"For Jan. 9, he's doing pretty well,\" Groeschner said.
