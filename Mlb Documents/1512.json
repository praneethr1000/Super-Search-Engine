    "body": "CINCINNATI -- The Reds and Triple-A Louisville announced Thursday that they have signed a two-year extension to their affiliation agreement that will now run through 2016.  The previous agreement was set to expire after the 2014 season.  Located about 90 minutes south of Cincinnati, down Interstate 71, Louisville became the Reds' top-tiered farm club in 2000. That was also the same season that Louisville Slugger Field opened. Mark Sheldon is a reporter for MLB.com. Read his blog, Mark My Word, and follow him on Twitter @m_sheldon.
