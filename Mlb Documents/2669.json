    "body": "CHICAGO -- Public visitation and memorial services for Mr. Cub, Ernie Banks, will be held Friday and Saturday at Fourth Presbyterian Church, the Cubs announced. The public visitation will be from 12-8 p.m. CT at the church, located at 126 East Chestnut Street, Chicago. On Saturday, there will be limited public seating available for the memorial service, scheduled to begin at 10 a.m. CT at the church. Banks passed away Friday after suffering a heart attack. He would have celebrated his 84th birthday on Saturday. In lieu of flowers, donations can be made in Banks' memory to Cubs Charities, 1060 W. Addison Street, Chicago, Ill., 60613, or by visiting cubs.com\/give and clicking \"Donate Now.\" There will be a public memorial for fans starting Wednesday at Daley Plaza in downtown Chicago. The bronze statue of Banks, which had been moved from Wrigley Field once renovation work began on the 100-year-old ballpark, will be installed at the outdoor plaza until Saturday. Banks, who played his entire career with the Cubs from 1953-71, was the first player in franchise history to be honored with a statue at Wrigley Field in 2008. The Cubs will announce in-season plans to honor Banks at a later date. The team is expected to wear a patch on their 2015 uniforms in Banks' memory. Carrie Muskat is a reporter for MLB.com.
