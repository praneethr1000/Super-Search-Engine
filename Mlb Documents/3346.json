    "body": "LOS ANGELES -- Dodgers right-handed reliever Blake Hawksworth underwent arthroscopic surgery on his elbow Wednesday to remove a bone spur and scar tissue only five weeks before the opening of Spring Training, the club announced. The surgery went as planned, the club said, with an estimated recovery time of four to six weeks. The 28-year-old had a decent first season with the Dodgers after being acquired from the St. Louis Cardinals for Ryan Theriot. He went 3-5 with a 4.08 ERA in 49 appearances, with one stint on the disabled list with a strained groin muscle. Hawksworth served as a middle and long reliever for the Dodgers. Because he is out of options, he was considered likely to make the Opening Day roster.  Nonetheless, the Dodgers have a solid group of right-handed relievers ahead of him -- Javy Guerra, Kenley Jansen, Mike MacDougal, Matt Guerrier and Josh Lindblom.
