    "body": "BALTIMORE -- Kevin Millar's priorities were different than other free agents this winter.  The veteran didn't want to move close to home or to a team where he'd have a guaranteed job. He just wanted to stay right in the thick of the action in the American League's East Division. Millar's wish became a reality Thursday afternoon, when he signed a one-year deal with a base worth $2.1 million with the Baltimore Orioles.  \"This division is where you want to be, as a baseball player. There's nothing like it, the American League East,\" he said. \"I grew up on the West Coast. You go to the game in the third inning [there] and leave in the seventh, see which movie star is sitting next to you. That's not baseball. Spencer Fordin is a reporter for MLB.com.
