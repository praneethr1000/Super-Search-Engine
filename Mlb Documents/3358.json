    "body": "CHICAGO -- Mark Buehrle, Juan Nieves and Joel Horlen find themselves as members of a very exclusive fraternity, but they don't have a secret handshake or memories of parties from college days to share.  Instead, they each have done something that has been accomplished just 255 times in the long and storied history of Major League Baseball.  On April 15, 1987, Nieves shut down future Hall of Famers such as Eddie Murray ad Cal Ripken Jr., as he held the Orioles hitless for the Brewers' ninth straight victory to start the season. On Sept. 10, 1967, Horlen no-hit the Tigers in a 6-0 win for the White Sox, mesmerizing top offensive threats such as Norm Cash, Al Kaline and Willie Horton. And in one of the three truly memorable moments from a dismal 2007 campaign for the White Sox, Buehrle fell one Sammy Sosa walk short of hurling baseball's 18th perfect game. The southpaw with a fastball in the high 80s still became one of the more unlikely candidates to complete the 16th no-hitter in team history on April 18 at U.S. Cellular Field.   All three historic hurlers joined together at SoxFest to sign autographs at the same table last Saturday afternoon, with Horlen now retired, Buehrle beginning a four-year, $56 million deal to stay on the South Side and Nieves serving in his first year as the White Sox bullpen coach. Following the autograph session, Buehrle, Nieves and Horlen spoke with MLB.com concerning numerous things related to firing a no-hitter.   MLB.com: Can you each explain what it basically feels like to throw a no-hitter? It would seem like a pitcher's dream, from Little League to the Majors.   Buehrle: I can't really say it's a dream come true, because you never really dream of it. They've [Nieves and Horlen] had a little more time to let it sink in, but I was doing the elliptical this offseason and I kind of had to look at myself and say, \"Was that from this year or was that from the year before?\" because we had such a bad year.   It will take a little bit of time for it to sink in, especially when I get out of baseball.   Horlen: I had lost one with two outs in the eighth and I lost another one with one out in the ninth. So I didn't know if it would ever happen. But when it did, it was really exhilarating. I acted out of character. I threw my glove up in the air and everything and jumped around like an idiot.   Nieves: My first outing in professional baseball was a seven-inning no-hitter during a doubleheader. I never thought of it again until actually during that game, when we got a larger lead. It was a 1-0 lead until the seventh, so you are thinking about the game and not really thinking about what's happening. We scored six in the [final three innings], and that's when I really started thinking about it -- mainly in the ninth.   But no, I never dreamt of it. It's like Hoyt Wilhelm once said, \"If it was that easy, I should have done it again.\" He hit a grand slam in his first at-bat and never hit another one.   MLB.com: How does the no-hitter rank in regard to your career accomplishments?   Buehrle: For me, on a personal level, I think it's the highest I've had. Winning the World Series, that's more of a team thing. On a personal level, I haven't had anything higher happen to me in the Major or Minor Leagues.   Horlen: I really enjoyed having a lengthy career and stuck around for 12 years.   Nieves: I was plagued with injuries early in my career. After three surgeries, I look back at being around the game and not seeing it. It certainly is impacting, but, yes, it covers a very short career as one of my highlights.   MLB.com: This no-hitter clearly must mean more to you as the only one in Brewers history.   Nieves: Absolutely. It's a shame. We had some good pitchers. There's a kid there now who has been plagued by injuries, a guy like Ben Sheets. I could see him throwing a no-hitter some day. It's sad.   MLB.com: Joel, did you watch Mark's no-hitter?   Horlen: I read about it in the paper the next day.   MLB.com: Being connected as the last two White Sox pitchers to throw no-hitters at home, have you talked before this SoxFest?   Buehrle: We just did an interview a couple of days before we came up here. It's the first time I've heard of him ever since throwing the no-hitter, and everyone was writing about how Joel Horlen threw the last one and compared me to him. It's the first we talked.   MLB.com: Was there one memorable moment that truly defined the no-hitter in your mind?   Buehrle: You mean when we knew we were going to get it? It was that last out. There were so many good defensive plays that saved it that there wasn't really one that I could pinpoint. I would say that final out, once that [Gerald Laird] ground ball went to [third baseman Joe] Crede, it kind of ...   After that, everything just became a blur. Even afterwards, that night going home, it was still an awesome feeling.   Horlen: I was just trying to stay in the game. I had been hit by a pitch [in the fourth inning] and my right knee was really throbbing, so it kind of took my mind off the game. I was just trying to get through the game.   Nieves: The thought that came up in the ninth inning, and it was a 7-0 game, I started thinking who was coming up. Cal Ripken was hitting like .700 early in the season and Eddie Murray was hitting a buck-40. That's when I thought, if anyone was going to break it, it would be Eddie. Cal Ripken was not going to break it.   That was the moment I really started thinking about it. I walked Ripken after two quick outs in the ninth and I said that I'm not going to give in to Cal and Eddie was the last out.   MLB.com: You walked five in the game, but never more than one in a single inning.   Nieves: Yes, I spread them out. Absolutely. I was effectively wild.   MLB.com: Mark walked Sosa and promptly picked him off first base, while Joel hit Bill Freehan with a pitch and had a Ken Boyer error made behind him. Did you two think about just missing perfection?   Buehrle: After the game was over, you kind of look back and say that was the only thing that happened away from perfection. Then you think about it. But it happened in the fifth inning and you still have four innings to go. I didn't think about it at all at the time.   Horlen: I was just trying to get three outs in the ninth. I had a good lead for the first time in a long time. I didn't really think about it all that much.   MLB.com: Have you all watched your respective no-hitters, at some point?   Buehrle: Kind of back and forth. They made up this nice CD of all the interviews afterwards -- ESPN, SportsCenter, and I was going through that during the offseason. It was motivation when I was doing some cardio at the house.   Horlen: Replay hadn't been invented yet [all three laugh]. I do have a recording, a tape from radio, but I haven't heard it yet.   Nieves: I saw it several years ago and never looked at it again. I've seen it maybe once or twice.   MLB.com: What goes through your mind on the mound when you see the last out recorded?   Buehrle: Like A.J. [Pierzynski], he kept saying, \"Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God.\" I don't know if it really hits you. You knew what happened, just how hard it is to throw a no-hitter. It happened, so now what do we do? Like A.J. said, you won a World Series so you just jump on each other. But this is a personal accomplishment. Obviously, A.J. calling the defense.   Everyone kind of mobbed me, and then you were like, \"What do we do now?\" You can't have it planned out. It just happens.   Horlen: I was kind of relieved, really. I was ready for the celebration later.   Nieves: My last out was Robin Yount's diving catch in right-center. After the game, he came up to me and said, \"Juan, I didn't have to dive. I could have caught that ball in the air.\" I was like, \"Thank you, Robin.\" He just wanted to make sure.   I saw the ball slicing a little bit to right-center field and I was going, \"No. No way.\" It's a fly ball instead of a line drive, and he caught it. Like Buehrle said, you can't really stage it. It's something that is reactionary. Everybody just got mobbed. It was a nice time. The no-hitter came when we won 12 in a row and started the season real hot.   MLB.com: Mark said that he talked about the no-hitter on the bench during the game. Did anyone else break with superstition in this same way?   Horlen: Not much was said during the game. I wasn't on the bench that much, walking around trying to stay loose.   Nieves: No, a 1-0 game, nobody said a word. It was very quiet.   MLB.com: As difficult as it is to throw a no-hitter, is it hard to fathom Nolan Ryan throwing seven?   Buehrle: If I had his kind of stuff, I'm not saying it would be easy, but it would be a lot easier than doing it with what I have.   MLB.com: You don't see seven no-hitters in your career?   Buehrle: No, I don't see more than one. I never did see one, so I guess I can't say I'll see another one. Scott Merkin is a reporter for MLB.com.
