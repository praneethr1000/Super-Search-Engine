    "body": "CINCINNATI -- Bob Castellini has wasted little time in putting his imprint on the Reds.  Just four days after Major League Baseball approved his ownership group to take over the club, Castellini dismissed general manager Dan O'Brien late Monday morning. A replacement was not named, but director of baseball operations Brad Kullman will take over as interim GM while Cincinnati seeks a replacement.  Castellini, who first announced his intentions to buy the Reds with partners Tom and Joe Williams in November, said his decision on O'Brien was essentially made before he assumed control as chief executive officer.
