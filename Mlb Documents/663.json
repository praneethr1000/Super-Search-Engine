    "body": "The A's avoided arbitration by agreeing to terms with right-handed pitcher Fernando Rodriguez and outfielder Josh Reddick on one-year contracts for the 2016 season, the club announced on Friday. Reddick compiled his best numbers in 2015 since '12, his first season with the A's, batting .272 with 20 home runs and 77 RBIs in 149 games. He had a career-high .333 on-base percentage, and his batting average was his best with Oakland. â€¢ A's Hot Stove Tracker Reddick led the A's in home runs, RBIs, slugging percentage (.449), total bases (236) and extra-base hits (49). Rodriguez started the year at Triple-A Nashville and posted a 2.81 ERA and .143 opponents' batting average in 10 games before being promoted to Oakland in May. He spent the rest of the season with the A's and went 4-2 with a 3.84 ERA and .200 opponents' average in 56 relief appearances. By virtue of agreements reached with infielders Danny Valencia and Yonder Alonso earlier this week, the A's have locked up all of the arbitration-eligible players on their roster.
