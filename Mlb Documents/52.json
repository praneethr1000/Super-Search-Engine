    "body": "Toronto added a little more depth to its bullpen by signing right-hander Ben Weber to a Minor League contract on Wednesday. Weber was also extended an invitation to attend Spring Training in Dunedin, Fla., with the big league club.  Weber, 36, has struggled with injuries over the last two seasons, but he was a integral part of the Angels team that won the World Series in 2002.  The 6-foot-4, 205-pound reliever spent last season with Cincinnati, but was on the disabled list for most of the season with a bulging disc in his neck. Weber appeared in only 10 games for the Reds and posted an 8.03 ERA. In 2004, Weber was 0-2 with an 8.06 ERA in 18 games for the Angels, who demoted him to Triple-A Salt Lake in June. He was bothered by carpal tunnel syndrome most of the year and spent much of his time on Salt Lake's disabled list with wrist problems. Weber was designated for assignment in September and then released before signing with Cincinnati that December. Those two seasons were a stark contrast to the two previous campaigns with the Angels. Weber went a combined 12-3 with a 2.61 ERA in 125 games across 2002-03. He went 7-2 with a 2.54 ERA in '02, when the Angels defeated San Francisco in seven games for the club's first World Series title. If he makes Toronto's Major League roster, Weber will join new third baseman Troy Glaus as members of that Angels team.   Weber has spent parts of six seasons in the Majors. He was originally drafted by Toronto in the 20th round of the 1991 First-Year Player Draft, but was released in 1996. He spent a portion of the 2000 season with San Francisco before being picked up off waivers that year by the Angels. Weber has a 19-8 career record with a 3.77 ERA.   Weber's closest competition for a bullpen job is probably young right-handers Dustin McGowan, 23, and 22-year-old Brandon League. Both will be trying to earn a spot with the Jays, but either could easily start with Triple-A Syracuse before being called up later. McGowan is still viewed as a future starter and League struggled in his short stint with Toronto last season.   The Blue Jays currently have 56 players attending Spring Training, including 17 non-roster invitees: left-handed pitchers Matt Blank, Adrian Burnside, David Purcey and Ricky Romero; right-handers Lee Gronkiewicz, Casey Janssen, Ty Taubenheim and Weber; catchers Robinzon Diaz, Erik Kratz, Mike Mahoney, Jason Phillips and Curtis Thigpen; infielders Kevin Barker and Luis Figueroa; and outfielders Wayne Lydon and Chad Mottola.
