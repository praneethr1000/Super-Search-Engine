    "body": "BALTIMORE -- The Orioles got the news they've been hoping for all winter on Saturday, when Baltimore shortstop Miguel Tejada reportedly rescinded his trade request. The Associated Press reported that Tejada spoke with the team's front office personnel late in the day and expressed a desire to stay with the O's, easing one of management's biggest concerns.  The AP quoted Jim Duquette, Baltimore's vice president of baseball operations. Tejada had requested a trade in early December and reiterated it as recently as 10 days ago, but everything apparently changed with a simple conversation.  \"This is the first time we heard this directly from him,\" Duquette told the AP. \"We're elated that he's chosen to stay. We're all committed to improving the team, and it's easier to do it with Miguel than without him.\" Spencer Fordin is a reporter for MLB.com.
