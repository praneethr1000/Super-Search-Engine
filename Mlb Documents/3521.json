    "body": "MILWAUKEE -- Craig Counsell was a 19-year-old at the University of Notre Dame when he met then-Oakland A's general manager Sandy Alderson and set his sights on a future in the front office.  \"For me, it was, 'That's what I want to do when I grow up. I want to be a GM,'\" Counsell said. \"Twenty years of playing got in the way. I'm happy that happened, but I thought back a couple of days ago that I'm finally doing what I thought I would be doing when I was 19 years old. That's pretty cool.\"  Counsell on Tuesday announced the end of a fine playing career that spanned parts of 16 Major League seasons and netted him two World Series rings, and the beginning of a new career in his hometown team's front office. The Brewers hired Counsell as a special assistant to general manager Doug Melvin, and Melvin made it very clear that this is no ceremonial position. Adam McCalvy is a reporter for MLB.com.
