    "body": "If 2011 was Pittsburgh's \"Tale of Two Seasons,\" its narrator was Kevin Correia.  Through mid-July, as the Pirates were turning the National League Central standings upside down, Correia had 11 wins and was an All-Star. Thereafter, he could pick up only one other victory before calling it a season with a strained left oblique, and the Bucs faded with him.  Yet the right-hander definitely set a tone, thus it is worth recalling that his signing as a free agent had been shrugged off as borderline insignificant. Tom Singer is a reporter for MLB.com.
