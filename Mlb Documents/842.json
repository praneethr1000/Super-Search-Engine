    "body": "OAKLAND -- A swarm of A's players and coaches, among them ace Sonny Gray and fellow fan favorites Stephen Vogt and Josh Reddick, will be on hand Sunday for the team's annual FanFest at the Coliseum and Oracle Arena. The popular trio will be joined by a handful of new teammates: first baseman Yonder Alonso, pitchers Rich Hill, John Axford, Liam Hendriks and Marc Rzepczynski, along with outfielder Andrew Lambo. The event will also feature appearances by a bevy of other returning players, among them outfielder\/first baseman Mark Canha, catcher Josh Phegley, designated hitter Billy Butler and infielders Marcus Semien, Danny Valencia, Eric Sogard, Max Muncy and Joey Wendle. Pitchers Jesse Hahn, Kendall Graveman, Chris Bassitt, Sean Nolin, Ryan Dull, Fernando Rodriguez, Aaron Brooks and Daniel Coulombe are scheduled to be in attendance as well. Many of these players will take part in autograph and question-and-answer sessions, featured among the many offered events. Fans will also have the opportunity to take photos with the club's four World Series trophies and tour the clubhouse. Others slated to be at FanFest include manager Bob Melvin and coaches Mark Kotsay, Ron Washington, Curt Young, Mike Aldrete, Darren Bush, Marcus Jensen and Scott Emerson. Tickets for the general public, priced at $10, can be purchased at athletics.com\/fanfest. Admission is free for children ages 6 and under, and parking is also free. Proceeds from the event, which runs from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. PT, will benefit the A's Community Fund. In addition, broadcaster Ken Korach will have a book signing of \"Holy Toledo: Lessons From Bill King, Renaissance Man of the Mic,\" with some of the proceeds also going to the A's Community Fund. Season-ticket plans and individual-game tickets will also be on sale during FanFest online at athletics.com\/tickets, at the Coliseum box office, or by calling 877-493-BALL.
