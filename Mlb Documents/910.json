    "body": "NEW YORK -- The Yankees and right-hander Ivan Nova avoided arbitration on Thursday, settling on a one-year contract. A source told MLB.com the deal is for $4.1 million with performance bonuses. The 29-year-old was inconsistent in his first season following Tommy John surgery, posting a 5.07 ERA and a 6-11 record in 17 starts after returning to the Yankees in June. Nova made $3.3 million in each of the past two years and, after having been dangled in trade talks this offseason, now projects to compete with left-hander CC Sabathia for the final spot in New York's rotation. In six big league seasons, Nova is 46-33 with a 4.33 ERA and a 1.393 WHIP. He is eligible for free agency after the 2016 campaign. Left-hander Aroldis Chapman is the only remaining Yankee who could head to arbitration. Chapman, acquired from the Reds on Dec. 28, requested $13.1 million, while the Yankees offered $9 million. He earned $8.05 million in 2015. Bryan Hoch is a reporter for MLB.com. Follow him on Twitter @bryanhoch, on Facebook and read his MLBlog, Bombers Beat.
