    "body": "Long-time utility infielder Orlando Cabrera announced his retirement from Major League Baseball on Wednesday while a guest on a Colombian radio station. Cabrera, a 15-year veteran of nine different franchises, retires after hitting .238 with five home runs and 51 RBIs in 130 games in 2011, split between the Indians (91 games) and the Giants (39 games).  The 36-year-old leaves the game having won one World Series with the Red Sox in 2004 and two Gold Glove Awards, with the Expos in '01 and the Angels in '07. Originally signed by the Montreal Expos as a free agent out of his native Colombia in 1993, Cabrera spent his first eight seasons in Montreal, including arguably his best year in 2003 when he played in 162 games and hit .297 with 17 home runs, 80 RBIs, 47 doubles and 25 stolen bases.  The following season, Cabrera was shipped to Boston in one of the biggest trades of the year -- part of a four-team deal where he replaced Nomar Garciaparra, who was traded to the Cubs. Cabrera hit .294 with six home runs and 31 RBIs in 58 games to conclude the 2004 season, and later hit .288 with 11 RBIs in the postseason, including a .379 mark and five RBIs in the American League Championship Series en route to Boston's first World Series title since 1918. Cabrera was something of a good luck charm for clubs in recent seasons, becoming the first player in Major League history to reach the postseason four consecutive years with four different teams from 2007-10. In those years, Cabrera appeared in October as a member of the Angels, White Sox, Twins and Reds, respectively.   Cabrera retires with a career .272 average, 123 home runs, 854 RBIs and 216 stolen bases in 1,985 games.   Jon Star is a reporter for MLB.com.
