    "body": "Chicago met St. Louis in Washington on Tuesday afternoon.  President Barack Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama greeted the World Series champion Cardinals at the White House in a renewal of one of sports' great traditions. A contingent of more than 30 entered the East Room around 2:30 p.m. CT, where they were honored by the First Family.  Michelle Obama spoke first, admitting that she is a Chicago Cubs fan, and of course the President is well known to be a die-hard White Sox fan. But they had nothing but good things to say about the champion Cardinals, hailing the team for its on- and off-field accomplishments. Matthew Leach is a reporter for MLB.com.
