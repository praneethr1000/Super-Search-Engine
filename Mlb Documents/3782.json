    "body": "PHILADELPHIA -- The Phillies crossed one name off their list of potential arbitration hearings on Monday, when they agreed to a one-year contract with outfielder Jayson Werth. Werth, who will earn $1.7 million in 2008 -- double what he earned last season -- was one of the team's six arbitration-eligible players. Outfielder Chris Snelling already agreed, while infielders Eric Bruntlett and Ryan Howard and right-handers Brad Lidge and Ryan Madson are still pending. Werth, 27, can also earn more through performance incentives. The right-handed hitter batted .298 with eight homers and a career-high 49 RBIs in 94 games in his first season with the Phillies. Werth also had nine outfield assists. Ken Mandel is a reporter for MLB.com. This story was not subject to the approval of Major League Baseball or its clubs.",
