    "body": "FARGO, N.D. -- The Twins avoided arbitration with left-handers Francisco Liriano and Glen Perkins, as they both agreed to terms on one-year deals for the 2012 season, the club announced Tuesday.  Liriano is set to earn $5.5 million in 2012, while Perkins will make $1.55 million.  The lone Twins player eligible for arbitration who remains unsigned is second baseman Alexi Casilla. Casilla, 27, filed his arbitration figure at $1.75 million, while the Twins offered $1.065 million. Casilla, who batted .260 with a .322 on-base percentage and .368 slugging percentage in 97 games in 2011, made $865,000 last year.   Perkins, 28, had a career year in 2011, posting a 2.48 ERA with 65 strikeouts, 21 walks and just two homers allowed in 61 2\/3 innings. He made $700,000 last season.   Liriano struggled last season, as he carried a 5.09 ERA with 112 strikeouts, 75 walks and 14 homers allowed in 134 1\/3 innings. The 28-year-old made $4.3 million in '11.   The Twins haven't gone to an arbitration hearing with a player since 2006, with Kyle Lohse.   They can still reach a deal with Casilla before their hearing, which will be held on an unspecified date between Feb. 1-21. Rhett Bollinger is a reporter for MLB.com.
