    "body": "Outfielder Matt Kemp and left-hander Clayton Kershaw will be honored on Saturday at 6 p.m. PT during the Negro Leagues Baseball Museum's Legacy Awards ceremony at Kansas City's Gem Theater.  Kemp, who finished second in the National League Most Valuable Player voting by the Baseball Writers' Association of America, will receive the Oscar Charleston Award, the museum's version of the MVP.  Kershaw, who won the BBWAA's NL Cy Young Award, will receive the Bullet Rogan Pitcher of the Year Award. The Legacy Awards were established by the Negro Leagues Baseball Museum in 2000 to recognize the best Major League players, managers and executives. Awards are given in the name, and spirit, of such Negro Leagues legends as Charleston, Josh Gibson, Cool Papa Bell and Buck O'Neil.   The event is part of the museum's yearlong Buck O'Neil Centennial Celebration, with proceeds benefiting the museum.   Kemp led the NL in home runs (39), RBIs (126), runs (115) and total bases (353) in 2011. He was third in the NL with a .324 batting average and tied for second with 40 stolen bases. His peers awarded him the NL's Most Outstanding Player Award in the Players Choice voting.   In addition, Kemp won the 2011 Hank Aaron Award, given to the best offensive performer in each league; captured his second Rawlings Gold Glove Award; and earned his second Silver Slugger Award.   Kershaw became just the 16th NL pitcher since 1900 to win pitching's Triple Crown. The 23-year-old led the Majors with a 2.28 ERA; tied Ian Kennedy for the NL lead in wins, with 21; and his 248 strikeouts led the NL.   Dazzy Vance and Sandy Koufax, who did it three times, are the only other Dodgers to have captured the Triple Crown.   Kershaw's peers awarded him the NL's Outstanding Pitcher Award in the Players Choice voting, and he also captured the Warren Spahn Award as the game's top left-handed pitcher.
