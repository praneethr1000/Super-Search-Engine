    "body": "ARLINGTON -- Japanese pitcher Yu Darvish and his father are in Arlington on Tuesday on what Rangers officials confirmed was nothing more than a \"visit.\"  The trip was described as part of the process to see the Ballpark in Arlington, the surrounding area and meet with some Rangers. Club president Nolan Ryan, manager Ron Washington and general manager Jon Daniels are all expected to be a part of the welcoming committee.  The Rangers issued a statement Tuesday morning concerning Darvish's visit this week, emphasizing that the club will not release details of the visit or make any further comment during the negotiation process. The Rangers won negotiating rights with Darvish with a bid of approximately $51.7 million before Christmas and have until 4 p.m. CT on Jan. 18 to sign him to a contract. If they are unable to do so, Darvish will return to the Nippon Ham Fighters, his former team in Japan.         T.R. Sullivan is a reporter for MLB.com.
