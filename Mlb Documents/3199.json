    "body": "ARLINGTON -- Rangers pitcher Alexi Ogando started his offseason workouts a month earlier than usual, as he prepares for his second full season as a starting pitcher.  Ogando has begun his conditioning program, and has also thrown a couple of bullpen sessions, he said Sunday at an appearance at Rangers FanFest at the Arlington Convention Center.  \"I'm spending more time getting ready this year to be a starter,\" Ogando said. \"It's an adjustment I have made. I have proven to myself that I can do it if I start earlier than I did last year.\" The Rangers could have a wealth of starters if they get a deal done with Japanese pitcher Yu Darvish by 4 p.m. CST on Wednesday, and if they sign a free agent such as Roy Oswalt. Under that scenario, and with Ogando's success out of the bullpen -- especially in the 2011 postseason -- it could be tempting to ask him to go back to being a reliever.   \"It's something that is out of my control,\" Ogando said. \"I don't think much about it. I'm going to prepare myself to be a starter. Either way I will be ready. Of course I want to be a starter, so I'm going to get ready for it.\"",
