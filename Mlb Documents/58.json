    "body": "PHILADELPHIA -- Brett Myers turned a breakout season into a substantial raise on Thursday, agreeing to a one-year, $3.3 million contract. The pact allows Myers and the Phillies to skip the first of what can be up to three years of arbitration eligibility for the right-hander, who can become a free agent after the 2008 season. Myers earned $445,000 in 2005, a year in which he went 13-8 with a 3.72 ERA in 34 starts, shaving nearly two runs off his ERA from the previous season. Though a poor stretch came in June and September, he was a valuable No. 2 starter behind ace Jon Lieber. Ken Mandel is a reporter for MLB.com.
