    "body": "ARLINGTON -- Yu Darvish, in his first news conference at Rangers Ballpark, was able to show some flashes of humor. At one point, he talked about his first visit earlier this month.  \"I looked at the right-field fence and I thought that was in too close,\" Darvish said in front of a room packed with a couple hundred members of the media on Friday night. \"I was asking my general manager if they could move it back. I don't know where they are on that yet.\"  His new general manager is Jon Daniels, who later responded by looking at Rangers slugger Josh Hamilton sitting in the front row and saying, \"I don't think Josh wants us to move them back. I'll let them arm-wrestle for it.\" T.R. Sullivan is a reporter for MLB.com. Read his blog, Postcards from Elysian Fields, and follow him on Twitter @Sullivan_Ranger.
