    "body": "SEATTLE -- By nature, Jeremy Reed is a confident player. But even he was humbled last season.  \"I learned how to fail,\" the Seattle Mariners center fielder said Saturday during the team's annual FanFest at Safeco Field.  Prior to last season, Reed had developed a reputation as a hitting machine, never batting below .275 in any of his Minor League stops and impressing the Mariners with a .397 average in 58 at-bats at the end of the 2004 campaign.
