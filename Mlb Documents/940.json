    "body": "LOS ANGELES -- The Dodgers outrighted right-handed pitcher Brandon Beachy to Triple-A on Wednesday, clearing a Major League roster spot. Beachy still will be a Major League camp invite. The move comes three weeks after Beachy signed a one-year, $1.5 million contract to rejoin the club, after spending the 2015 season in the organization on the rebound from a second Tommy John elbow reconstruction. Because of the operations, Beachy has made only seven Major League starts since mid-2012. Ken Gurnick is a reporter for MLB.com. This story was not subject to the approval of Major League Baseball or its clubs.",
