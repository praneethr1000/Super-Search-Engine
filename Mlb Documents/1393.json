    "body": "PHOENIX -- D-backs Chris Johnson, Ian Kennedy, Gerardo Parra, Cliff Pennington, Tony Sipp and Brad Ziegler were among the 133 Major League players who filed for salary arbitration Tuesday.  Players who filed and their respective clubs have until Friday to exchanged salary proposals for the 2013 season. Hearings will be scheduled for sometime between Feb. 4-20, but negotiations can continue. If no deal is reached, an arbitration panel will choose either the club's figure or the player's, nothing in between.  This is the first time Johnson, Kennedy, Parra, Sipp and Pennington have been eligible for arbitration. Steve Gilbert is a reporter for MLB.com. Follow him on Twitter @SteveGilbertMLB.
