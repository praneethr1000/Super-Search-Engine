TMZ reported that Romo, 29, failed to produce the proper identification to clear security and was halted by police. At that point, TMZ said, Romo jawed with a Transportation Security Administration officer and was handcuffed. Reports said that Romo then was taken to the airport police station, cited for violating airport rules and released. He was not allowed to board the flight he was scheduled to take. Romo issued a statement through the Giants: Chris Haft is a reporter for MLB.com. This story was not subject to the approval of Major League Baseball or its clubs.",
