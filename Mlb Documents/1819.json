    "body": "The Royals have signed reliever Ryan Madson to a Minor League contract, the club announced on Sunday. Madson, 34, hasn't pitched in the Majors since the 2011 season because of elbow injuries, but he saved 32 games for the Phillies that year. He signed with the Reds for $6 million before the 2012 season and with the Angels for $3.25 million before the '13 season but did not appear in a game for either team. Madson's only game action in that time was one outing for the Angels' Class A Advanced team in 2013, a scoreless inning to record a save. Madson's deal with the Royals comes with an invitation to Major League Spring Training. Over nine seasons with Philadelphia, Madson worked primarily out of the bullpen and went 47-30 with a 3.59 ERA. The right-hander, who has 52 career saves, will be fighting for a spot in Kansas City's formidable bullpen. Joey Nowak is a reporter for MLB.com. Follow him on Twitter at @joeynowak.
