    "body": "ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. -- Detectives believed the former Yankees trainer who says he injected Roger Clemens with steroids lied to them during the 2001 investigation of a possible rape, according to documents released Tuesday by police.  Police said Brian McNamee denied having sex with a possibly drugged woman in a hotel pool, even though security guards and other witnesses said they saw him.  McNamee hired a New York attorney, who called detectives to arrange an interview. \"I explained to him that his client did talk with me once, and he lied to me,\" St. Petersburg Police Detective Donald Crotty wrote in a report.   The state attorney's office, however, decided not to press charges.   Clemens cited the incident as an example of McNamee's dishonesty in a defamation lawsuit filed Sunday in Texas.   The seven-time Cy Young Award winner says his former personal trainer lied to baseball investigator George Mitchell to avoid prosecution when he said he injected Clemens at least 16 times with steroids and human growth hormone in 1998, 2000 and 2001. Clemens acknowledged receiving injections from McNamee but said they were vitamin B-12 and the painkiller lidocaine.   \"The significant thing is, when this guy's rear end is in trouble, does he lie?\" said Rusty Hardin, Clemens' attorney.   The defamation suit states: \"McNamee's explanation was totally at odds with the conclusions of the police officers conducting the official investigation in St. Petersburg.\"   Earl Ward, one of McNamee's attorney, denied the St. Petersburg incident had any bearing on his client's credibility. He said McNamee's statement about Clemens was found credible by the staff of former Senate majority leader Mitchell and federal law enforcement officials investigating steroid use in professional sports.   \"The bottom line is that allegation in Florida was investigated, and it went nowhere,\" Ward said.   \"It's just an attempt to further damage his character,\" he said. \"It has no relevance.\"   The records released Tuesday by the St. Petersburg police show McNamee was suspected of raping a woman he had met at the Renaissance Vinoy Resort in October 2001. The Yankees were in town to close out the regular season against the Rays, and many players and support staff were staying at the upscale resort.   McNamee was having sex with the woman in the resort's pool and didn't stop when confronted by security, the documents say. Police were notified. When they arrived, they found McNamee had helped the woman out of the pool and get dressed, according to the documents. Groggy and incoherent, she was taken to the hospital, where the documents said she was found to have GHB, the \"date-rape drug,\" in her system.   The woman told detectives she could not remember details of the encounter in the pool. She said she did not give McNamee permission to have sex with her, and witnesses told detectives they had heard her saying \"no\" during the encounter, according to the documents.   Detectives later recovered some of her jewelry, an empty beer can and a water bottle containing GHB at the side of the pool.   Police interviewed McNamee hours later, according to the documents, and he denied having sex with the woman or knowing Yankees batting practice pitcher, Charles Wonsowicz, who was also in the pool. McNamee refused to submit a saliva sample for DNA analysis, the documents said.   Although the state attorney's office decided not to press charges, the accusations ended McNamee's career with the Yankees.   The Yankees did not give a specific reason for terminating McNamee.   Clemens then hired McNamee as his personal trainer. According to the pitcher's lawsuit, McNamee told him that his actions were \"actually a life-saving attempt.\"",
