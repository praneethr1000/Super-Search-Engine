    "body": "NEW YORK -- Word of Jorge Posada's decision to retire had already leaked by the time the Yankees shipped designated hitter Jesus Montero to the Mariners in a four-player trade, but Posada said he never -- not even for a second -- reconsidered.  \"No, [it did] not even cross my mind,\" Posada said. \"I didn't even think about DHing for them or anything, because I knew it wasn't going to happen.\"  Posada said that if the Yankees had wanted him back, he would not have approached the offseason any differently. Posada said that he never started his regular winter training, knowing after the American League Division Series that there were no next games to prepare for. \"I knew at the end of that game,\" Posada said. \"That's why I got so emotional, because I knew that was it.\"   Derek Jeter opined that he still believes Posada could hit Major League pitching if he wanted to, but general manager Brian Cashman said he did not consider bringing Posada back for 2012, even after Montero was deleted from New York's DH mix.   \"The trade was certainly kind of unexpected, but an opportunity I felt was worth taking,\" Cashman said. \"But once it was made, I didn't necessarily feel all of sudden that Jorge should be a consideration for that position.\"   Asked if he was surprised by the Yankees' trade of Montero, Posada replied, \"When you need pitching, it's tough to trade somebody like that, but [if] you're trying to get somebody, you have to trade somebody.\" Bryan Hoch is a reporter for MLB.com.
