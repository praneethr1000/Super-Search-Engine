    "body": "ARLINGTON -- Blue Jays reliever Darren Oliver is considering the possibility of retirement after a 19-year career if Toronto doesn't raise his salary or trade him to the Rangers.  The Blue Jays picked up Oliver's $3 million option for 2013 after he went 3-4 with a 2.06 ERA in 62 games this past season. The 2.06 ERA was the lowest in Oliver's career, but his $3 million salary is far less than the three-year, $18 million contract that the Giants gave left-handed reliever Jeremy Affeldt this offseason.  Oliver, 42, pitched for the Rangers in 2010-11 and his family still lives in Tarrant County. He would prefer to pitch for the Rangers or retire if the Blue Jays aren't willing to address his contract situation. T.R. Sullivan is a reporter for MLB.com.
