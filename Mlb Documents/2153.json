    "body": "ARLINGTON -- The Rangers avoided an arbitration hearing with pitcher Neftali Feliz by agreeing to a one-year, $4,125,000 contract on Thursday. The Rangers still have two arbitration cases pending, with first baseman Mitch Moreland and pitcher Ross Detwiler. On Friday, clubs are scheduled to exchange arbitration figures with their players and hearings will be held in February. The Rangers haven't gone to an arbitration hearing with a player since 2000 and expect to avoid one with Detwiler and Moreland. Feliz, finally returning from Tommy John elbow reconstruction surgery, appeared in 30 games for the Rangers last season and was 2-1 with a 1.99 ERA. He was the Rangers' closer in 2010-11 before going down with an elbow injury. He didn't regain his closer's role until the Rangers traded Joakim Soria to the Tigers at the end of last July. Feliz is not eligible for free agency until after the 2016 season. The Rangers have not had any serious discussions about a long-term contract. T.R. Sullivan is a reporter for MLB.com.
