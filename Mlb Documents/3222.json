    "body": "ARLINGTON -- Second baseman Ian Kinsler said Saturday at Rangers FanFest that he feels the best he has physically in two years.  Kinsler, who rolled his right ankle in Spring Training of 2010, said he has been fighting the injury for two seasons because the sprain was so severe that a ligament became attached to his ankle bone. Team doctors used a platelet-rich plasma treatment a week after the World Series ended to separate the ligament from the bone.  \"I'm able to work out and do everything I want to do with nothing holding me back,\" Kinsler said. \"It's always been something for me. I'm actually having fun training. I'm 100 percent. It's the first time I can say that in a long time.\" Kinsler put together a 30-30 season last year with 32 home runs and 30 stolen bases, but said he fought the ankle all the way to the end of the season. The injury forced him to run differently on his ankle, and changed the way he ran the bases.   \"I learned how to cheat stealing bases,\" Kinsler said. \"Picking up small things and figuring out how to steal a base. How to get the best possible jump you can.\"  It also impacted his power, he said.   \"It took power away from me,\" Kinsler said. \"I didn't feel as powerful as I have in the past. Being able to feel that is pretty cool.\"  Kinsler, who has played now in six seasons, said he is still interested in signing long-term with the Rangers. He said there is open dialogue between him and the team. He will make $7 million in 2012, and the Rangers have a club option for $10 million in 2013.  Earlier this offseason, Rangers general manager Jon Daniels said he'd like to start working on keeping the nucleus of the club together. But with the signing of Japanese pitcher Yu Darvish and the possible courtship of free-agent first baseman Prince Fielder, Kinsler said dealings with the Rangers have and should take a back seat.   \"It's not frustrating,\" Kinsler said. \"Baseball is a lucrative business. On the other hand, it's confusing when something is said and it doesn't get to the point. Obviously the offseason isn't over and there's still time. We're all about winning here. This could be the beginning of a dynasty in my opinion. I am always optimistic. Take a note from Tim Tebow.   \"I know what I'm worth; they know what I'm worth.\"",
