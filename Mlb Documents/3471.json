    "body": "DETROIT -- The concourses of Comerica Park were quiet Saturday morning, with Tigerfest postponed for ballpark renovations. That doesn't mean the Tigers were back into hibernation with the close of their Winter Caravan.  While kids and parents alike cheered, Tigers teammates Rick Porcello and Austin Jackson engaged in a friendly competition of hat toss, trying to land a baseball cap onto a bat. Fellow Tigers Brandon Inge and Doug Fister tried to see how far they could roll ping-pong balls down a tape measure.  Inge was hob-hobbing not only with PAWS, but Super Grover and a bevy of mascots. He was also the volunteer assistant in a magic act. It wasn't the usual activities the Tigers embark on around this time of year, but the first Tigers Kids Convention left a lot of kids happy.   \"That was fun. They did a good job,\" Inge said afterward at the FOX Theatre. \"The kids stuff is always fun. Plus, this place is cool. I've been here three or four times. There's a lot of history here. ...   \"The good thing is you can see on the kids' faces how much they enjoy this. That's the biggest part.\"   About 2,600 tickets were sold for the event, according to a Tigers spokesperson.   The idea came together without a whole lot of advance notice, announced just a couple of weeks after the Tigers announced they would not be able to hold TigerFest. It was difficult to tell from the program put together for the one-hour, 45-minute program. Inge, Porcello, Jackson and Fister joined Ramon Santiago, Max Scherzer, Don Kelly, Brennan Boesch and new Tigers pitcher Collin Balester in the stage show.   \"Giving back to the kids is the biggest part,\" Balester said.   It was a different experience for many of them, compared to what they're used to doing on the caravan. They still had question-and-answer sessions, but maybe some different questions than usual.   One young fan asked Inge how hard it is to get into the Major Leagues. The 5-foot-11 Inge got out of his chair and stood side-by-side with the 6-foot-8 Fister to make a point about the work involved.   \"You have to have work ethic and dedication to be a good baseball player,\" Inge said. \"A lot of things have to go right.\"   Another fan asked Jackson how he became a Major League player.   \"A lot of practice,\" Jackson said. \"A lot of swings.\"   For Balester, it wrapped up the reliever's first offseason bonding with his new team, having arrived last month from the Nationals in the Ryan Perry trade. His real work begins in about four weeks, when pitchers and catchers officially report to Spring Training in Lakeland, Fla. But he liked having this opportunity to get to know the people and personalities on the squad.   \"If they're this excited for the caravan, they're going to be really excited for the game,\" Balester said. \"So I'm excited.\" Jason Beck is a reporter for MLB.com.
