    "body": "After racking up more than $100 million at the box office, Bennett Miller's film \"Moneyball\" added to its success on Tuesday, becoming the most-nominated baseball movie at the Academy Awards since \"The Pride of the Yankees\" in 1943.  The film, based on general manager Billy Beane's attempt to assemble a competitive Oakland A's team in the 2002 season despite a limited payroll, racked up six Oscar nominations, including one for best picture. It's the most nominations since \"The Pride of the Yankees\" received 11, and it also beat out other baseball classics such as \"The Natural\" (four), \"Field of Dreams\" (two) and \"Bull Durham\" (one).  Along with best picture, it's nominated for both best actor and best supporting actor for Brad Pitt's and Jonah Hill's depictions of Beane and assistant GM Peter Brand, respectively. \"Moneyball\" is also up for best adapted screenplay, best sound mixing and best film editing. The six nominations are a good start for \"Moneyball,\" as it looks to become the first baseball movie to take home an Oscar in a best picture or best acting category. Despite its 11 nominations in 1943, \"The Pride of the Yankees\" won an Oscar in only one category -- best film editing.   The 84th annual Academy Awards will take place at the Kodak Theatre in Hollywood on Feb. 26.   The nominations come less than two weeks after Miller's motion picture failed to take home any hardware at the Jan. 15 Golden Globe Awards, despite also being nominated in the best picture, best actor, best supporting actor and best screenplay categories.
