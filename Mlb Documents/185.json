    "body": "CLEVELAND -- Eduardo Perez will be paying a visit to Jacobs Field early next week, and the Indians are expected to sign the free agent first baseman to a one-year deal. Perez will report to Cleveland for a physical examination that will take place Tuesday, according to a team source. If all goes well, the deal, which might include an option for a second year, should be completed. \"We've had serious discussions,\" general manager Mark Shapiro said. \"We like the player and think he'd be a good complement to our club. It's not a done deal, but at this point we're optimistic.\" Anthony Castrovince is a reporter for MLB.com. This story was not subject to the approval of Major League Baseball or its clubs.",
