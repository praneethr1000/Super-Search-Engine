    "body": "HOUSTON -- As expected, the surgery to clean out scar tissue in Lance Berkman's right knee went off without a hitch on Thursday.  Performed by team medical director Dr. David Lintner at the Methodist Hospital, the surgery cleaned out scar tissue that had developed as a result of the 2004 procedure that repaired a torn ACL in Berkman's knee.  \"The surgery confirmed the MRI that there was a build-up in scar tissue,\" general manager Tim Purpura said. \"Dr. Lintner really feels this will give Lance a return to some pretty good range of motion.\" Berkman has spent much of the offseason conducting a steady workout regimen without incident, but in recent weeks he began feeling discomfort in his knee that didn't feel like normal soreness. An MRI revealed he had developed scar tissue and the club immediately scheduled the surgery, which will require a four-to-six week recovery period.  \"His meniscus looked good, and his ACL looked outstanding,\" Purpura said.  Berkman, who turns 30 on Feb. 10, does not expect to miss a lot of Spring Training. He will likely be ready to play when the Grapefruit League season begins on March 2, but he withdrew his name from the United States roster for the World Baseball Classic.
