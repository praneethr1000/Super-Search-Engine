    "body": "The Pirates unveiled a series of Minor League coaching staff changes on Friday, as new managers will take over at six of the organization's eight affiliates.  Dean Treanor, who directed Triple-A Indianapolis to a league-best 89-55 record a year ago, will return for his third season with the Indians. Treanor also led the club to a winning record in 2011.  The Pirates promoted Carlos Garcia to skipper of Double-A Altoona. He spent the previous two seasons with Class A Advanced Bradenton, where Frank Kremblas will take the reins. Kremblas served as a special assistant to Minor League operations last year. He managed Indianapolis in 2009-10. Michael Ryan was named manager at Class A West Virginia and Dave Turgeon received the nod as skipper of Class A Jamestown. Milver Reyes will take over the reigning champion Gulf Coast League Pirates.   Gera Alvarez will stay on for his second season as manager of one of the organization's Dominican Summer League teams. Keoni De Renne will captain the other squad. Zack Meisel is a reporter for MLB.com. Follow him on Twitter @zackmeisel.
