    "body": "The Orioles acquired left-handed pitcher Daniel Rodriguez from the Braves on Friday in exchange for cash considerations. Rodriguez, who has not yet pitched in the Majors, spent last season at Triple-A Gwinnett, appearing in 29 games (21 starts). In 125 innings, he posted a 5.04 ERA, walked 49 batters and struck out 111. He fared much better against left-handed batters, holding them to a .241\/.308\/.345 line. The 30-year-old southpaw pitched for Saltillo in the Mexican League from 2006-12, when he signed with the Braves. Rodriguez also pitched in Mexico this winter for Culiacan and had a 3.68 ERA and 25 strikeouts over 29 1\/3 innings, mostly out of the bullpen. Andrew Simon is a reporter for MLB.com.
