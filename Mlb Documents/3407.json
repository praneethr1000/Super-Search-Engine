    "body": "The Rockies and right-hander Rafael Betancourt on Sunday agreed to a one-year contract extension with a mutual option for 2013. The extension, first reported by ESPNdeportes.com, is pending a physical. A source confirmed the deal to MLB.com on Monday. A formal announcement of the agreement has not been made by the Rockies. Already signed through 2011 for $3.77 million, Betancourt will earn $4 million in 2012 and could earn $4.25 million in 2013 if both sides pick up the option. He would receive a $250,000 buyout if the Rockies decline the option, and the buyout becomes guaranteed if Betancourt is traded, the Denver Post reported. The 35-year-old went 5-1 with a 3.61 ERA in 72 appearances last season, striking out 89 and walking eight in 62 1\/3 innings. This will be his ninth Major League season.
