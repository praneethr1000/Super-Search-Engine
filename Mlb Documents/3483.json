    "body": "I knew it. I just knew this was going to happen. I'm recalling August 1988, when I sat in the press box at Wrigley Field shaking my head over the horror of it all.  For the first time since, well, forever, the Chicago Cubs were preparing for a home game without sunshine. It was against the Philadelphia Phillies, and the sky was threatening to turn dark over the city's North Side.  Then the Cubs flipped a switch to introduce night baseball to Wrigley, and I just knew there were more horrors to come. Like something called the Budweiser Patio section.   I'm clenching my teeth right now, which means the following are the words of a baseball purist: What are they doing to baseball's best ballpark not near a Golden Gate Bridge?   Over the weekend, Cubs officials announced at their annual fan convention that they are going to \"reconfigure\" -- which is never a good word if you don't like folks throwing knockdown pitches at tradition -- Wrigley's right-field bleachers.   Wrigley's right-field bleachers are just fine, thank you, and the same goes for the ones in left and center fields. As a matter of fact, except for the cramped quarters around both clubhouses, there isn't much wrong with the whole ballpark, but I'm getting ahead of myself.   Back to the Budweiser Patio section.   According to Cubs officials, these newfangled stands won't require an addition to Wrigley. It's worse -- well, by my purist standards. The Budweiser Patio will cause the demolition of the current right-field bleachers and the replacement of them with what amounts to luxury boxes for big wigs with big bucks.   The patio will hold approximately 150 folks along its projected three levels. It's highest level will feature tables for those wishing to either stand or sit while enjoying the food and the beverages that will be included in the price of a ticket.   \"We're thrilled to expand our partnership with Budweiser and offer our fans an exciting new experience in the right-field Budweiser Bleacher section at Wrigley Field,\" said Wally Hayward, the Cubs' executive vice president, chief sales and marketing officer. \"The Budweiser Patio will provide our fans with a rooftop experience inside the ballpark and more baseball content during the game on our new 75-foot LED board.\"   Strike one.   A 75-foot LED board? At a place whose charm is that you can look around and not tell if it's now or the 1940s?   Actually, that's strike two.   Strike one was when Hayward said this will provide those inside Wrigley with a \"rooftop experience.\"   Sorry, Mr. Hayward, but when you're inside a ballpark, you should experience a \"ballpark experience.\" If you want a \"rooftop experience,\" you should knock on the door of one of those apartment buildings behind Wrigley's outfield walls on Waveland and Sheffield Avenues.   Come to think of it, Cubs officials struck out as soon as they came up with this idea.   I'm the purist speaking, again, and nothing is more pure than the ballpark that hosted its first Cubs game in 1916.   Two decades later, Wrigley began to acquire its distinctive magic, and the bleachers were a huge part of that. They were a haven for the common man. Thus the term \"Bleacher Bums,\" and the place has included everything from hearty souls in hard hats to endless chanting of Ronnie \"Woo Woo\" Wickers to tickets that don't cost as much as your mortgage.   The Wrigley bleachers virtually have been the same since Philip K. Wrigley ordered their construction in 1937.   That same year, Wrigley's general manager, Bill Veeck, had a brainstorm for the ages: plant ivy to have it grow thick and green across the red-brick walls of the outfield.   So Wrigley had the bleachers thing, the ivy thing -- and then the scoreboard thing.   The latter is manually operated, and it also was one of Veeck's masterpieces for the ages in 1937. It sits high behind the center-field bleachers with the inning-by-inning results displayed for every game in the Major Leagues for that day.   There is no video screen for replays or for races involving batting helmets, mechanical tools or anything else. Plus, the scoreboard is punctuated by a distinctive clock that famously has never lost time during its seven decades.   There also is the sign thing.   It's located above the ballpark's main entrance at the corner of Clark and Addison, and it declares with its old-school design: \"Wrigley Field, Home of the Chicago Cubs.\"   I told you about that daylight thing for the Cubs. It vanished that night in August 1988, when they quickly became like everybody else with a night game, but there was a stipulation. According to a city ordinance, they only could play a maximum of 18 night games per season to keep from disturbing those in the residential neighborhood that surrounds Wrigley.   Now the Cubs can play a maximum of 30 night games, and they are seeking to play even more.   There also was that Toyota sign placed above the left-field bleachers for the 2010 season.   See where this is going?   Before long, they'll have the McDonald's Pavilion replacing the center-field bleachers. Then they'll have the Starbucks Loft taking over what used to be the left-field bleachers.   Then they'll replace the ivy along the outfield walls with padding featuring more advertising.   Then I'll scream.   Terence Moore is a columnist for MLB.com. This story was not subject to the approval of Major League Baseball or its clubs.",
