    "body": "SAN DIEGO -- The Padres on Monday agreed to terms with left-handed pitcher Clayton Richard on a one-year contract worth $2.705 million. Richard was one of two remaining arbitration-eligible players, along with pitcher Dustin Moseley. Last week, Richard had asked for $3.1 million. The team countered with an offer of $2.35 million. Richard made $468,000 last season. Richard was 5-9 with a 3.88 ERA in 18 starts last season, before landing on the disabled list in July.  Richard was first placed on the disabled list July 5 with a shoulder strain. He then tried to take the path of rehabilitation and treatment before the team decided he needed to have arthroscopic surgery. The surgery took place July 29.  Richard was in San Diego on Monday to work out at Petco Park. He is on schedule and will be ready for the start of Spring Training next month.  The only remaining player without a contract for 2012 is Moseley. Last week, Moseley asked for $2.55 million while the club has offered $1.5 million.  The Padres can continue to negotiate with Moseley up to his arbitration hearing, which is scheduled somewhere between Feb. 1-21 in St. Petersburg, Fla.  The team was able to sign nine of its 11 arbitration-eligible players on Jan. 17, as it settled with pitchers Edinson Volquez, Luke Gregerson, Tim Stauffer and Joe Thatcher, catchers Nick Hundley and John Baker, third baseman Chase Headley and outfielders Will Venable and Carlos Quentin.  Pitchers and catchers report to the Padres' Spring Training facility in Arizona on Feb. 18 with the first workout scheduled for the following day. Corey Brock is a reporter for MLB.com.
