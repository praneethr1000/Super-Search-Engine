    "body": "Four days after signing catcher Chris Snyder as a free agent, the Astros made room for him on the 40-man roster Tuesday by designating utility infielder Angel Sanchez for assignment. The Astros will have 10 days to trade, release or outright Sanchez to the Minors. Sanchez, 28, hit .240 (69-for-288) with 28 RBIs in 110 games for the Astros in 2011. He started 41 games at short, 14 at second and eight at third. The Astros initially acquired him from the Red Sox in exchange for catcher Kevin Cash in July 2010. Also on Tuesday, the Astros announced that they have hired Mike Fast of Baseball Prospectus to work in their baseball operations department. Fast, an expert in advance analytics, will work under director of decision sciences Sig Mejdal as part of the Astros' increasing efforts to become statistically savvy. Fast will work in a part-time role until becoming a full-timer in June. Anthony Castrovince is a reporter for MLB.com.
