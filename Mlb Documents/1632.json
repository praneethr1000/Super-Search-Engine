    "body": "The Blue Jays signed corner infielder Andy LaRoche to a Minor League contract, with an invitation to the club's Major League Spring Training camp. LaRoche, 29, split last season between Triple-A Columbus and Pawtucket, posting a combined .251\/.335\/.422 batting line, with 20 doubles, 12 homers and 41 RBIs. He last played in the Majors in 2011, batting .247 with a .654 OPS in 40 games for the A's. LaRoche has played in the Majors for parts of five seasons, totaling 403 games with the Dodgers, Pirates and A's. He was Pittsburgh's everyday third baseman in 2009, posting a .258\/.330\/.401 batting line, with 29 doubles, 12 homers and 64 RBIs in 150 games. The right-handed hitter is a career .226 hitter in the Majors, with a .285\/.372\/.492 batting line in eight Minor League seasons. Toronto also lost a player Wednesday, as right-hander Sam Dyson was claimed off waivers by Miami. Dyson made two appearances in the Majors last season, giving up three runs on four hits and two walks while recording only two outs. In 33 games with Double-A New Hampshire, Dyson recorded a 2.38 ERA and nine saves. Adam Berry is a reporter for MLB.com. Follow him on Twitter at @adamdberry.
