    "body": "MILWAUKEE -- The Brewers finalized a Minor League contract for outfielder Corey Patterson on Monday, a deal that assistant general manager Gord Ash hinted was in the works during Sunday's \"Brewers On Deck\" event.  Patterson will likely play left in a Triple-A Nashville outfield that is expected to feature a pair of prospects: Logan Schafer in center field and Caleb Gindl in right. Both Schafer and Gindl are on the 40-man roster and will be in Major League Spring Training camp.  Patterson will not be with the big leaguers in Arizona beginning next month, though he did receive an invitation to an early minicamp at the club's Minor League complex. The 32-year-old finished last season with the World Series champion Cardinals, but was left off their postseason roster.  Adam McCalvy is a reporter for MLB.com.
