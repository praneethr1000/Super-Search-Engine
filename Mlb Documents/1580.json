    "subtitle": "",
    "body": "The D-backs officially announced Wednesday that shortstop Cliff Pennington avoided arbitration by signing a two-year deal. ESPN's Buster Olney first reported the agreement, and a source confirmed the two-year, $5 million contract to MLB.com last week. Pennington filed for $2.8 million in arbitration, and the D-backs offered $1.8 million. The 28-year-old Pennington came to Arizona along with reliever Heath Bell in a three-team trade with Oakland and Miami on Oct. 20. A career .249 hitter, Pennington posted a .215\/.278\/.311 batting line with six homers and 28 RBIs in 125 games with the A's last season. He played 93 games at shortstop, and among shortstops with at least 75 games played, he ranked third in the Majors with a .859 zone rating and seventh in the American League with a .979 fielding percentage. Pennington's agreement leaves Arizona with just one remaining arbitration-eligible player, outfielder Gerardo Parra. He filed at $2.7 million, and the D-backs offered $2.1 million. The D-backs have not gone to an arbitration hearing with a player since Damian Miller in 2001. Adam Berry is a reporter for MLB.com. Follow him on Twitter at @adamdberry.
