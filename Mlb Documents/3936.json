    "body": "ST. LOUIS -- The Cardinals Hall of Fame and Museum still lacks a brick-and-mortar home, but at least it has an address online, as the club announced on Monday the formal launch of its museum and hall of fame at Cardinals.com\/museum.  \"We wanted to create a place to showcase our vast museum collection while giving fans a chance to learn more about the rich history of the Cardinals,\" team president Bill DeWitt III said in a statement issued by the club.  The physical museum closed in 2008 with the idea that it would be replaced by a new, grander facility in the planned Ballpark Village development adjacent to the new Busch Stadium. Though that facility has not yet come to fruition, many of the exhibits and artifacts can now be viewed online. The three main pillars of the online museum are \"Cardinalographies,\" \"Inside the Collection\" and \"Virtual Exhibits.\"   \"Cardinalographies\" are video biographies of Cardinals greats, such as Frank Frisch, Joe Medwick and Pepper Martin. These videos include clips of the players as well as commentary from the present day.   When fans go \"Inside the Collection,\" they can get a look at some of the items the club has on hand. Current videos highlight treasures from the most recent season, the 2011 World Series championship run, as well as the World Series trophy.   There are several collections on the photo galleries page. One that is sure to draw fans is a series of Stan Musial photos; other galleries include a look at jerseys through the years and a history of the name \"Cardinals.\"   In addition, the site features a \"Question to the Fans,\" soliciting fans' memories and takes on their experiences with the club. There will also be a \"theme of the week,\" highlighting particular aspects of the collection. Matthew Leach is a reporter for MLB.com.
