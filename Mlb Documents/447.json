    "body": "ATLANTA -- In essence, it will be the same preseason opportunity for Braves pitchers to voluntarily participate in a throwing program. But it obviously will no longer be called Camp Leo.  Nor will it be called Camp Roger or Camp McDowell or Camp Where You Learn to Pitch and Set Your Teammate's Shoe on Fire.  When new pitching coach Roger McDowell meets with Braves pitchers and catchers at Turner Field next week, he wants everybody to refer to the 10-day event simply as the Braves Early Throwing Program. While the name may lack the excitement McDowell used to create, when he'd light a teammate's shoes on fire, it certainly explains exactly what the event is. It's simply a chance for Atlanta pitchers to get their arms ready for the start of Spring Training.   In addition, it will also allow them to get better acquainted with McDowell, who was named the club's pitching coach after Leo Mazzone left in October to accept the same position in Baltimore.   \"I'm excited about getting out there and watching the guys throw,\" McDowell said. \"It will give me a chance to get more familiar with everybody. I've talked to a lot of the guys already to get a feel for them. But it isn't until you're able to see the guys face to face and put faces with names that you really become familiar with them.\"   The Braves Early Throwing Program begins Wednesday at Turner Field and runs through Feb. 11. All Braves pitchers and catchers are welcome, but not required, to attend the event, which the team has annually staged since 1991 -- the year they won the first of their now record 14 consecutive division titles.   Braves pitchers and catchers are scheduled to report to Spring Training on Feb. 16.   John Smoltz and Tim Hudson headline the list of pitchers who are expected to participate in next week's event. If weather permits, they'll throw off the bullpen mounds. But as they often have in the past when it's been cold, they also can throw off the mounds in the indoor batting cages.   McDowell isn't setting any specifics on the amount of times guys should throw off the mound. Having spent 12 seasons as a big league pitcher, he understands everybody's arm is different and thus should be prepared in different manners.   \"This is just retraining after taking the winter off,\" McDowell said. \"I know a lot of the guys have been throwing already. But it's always good just to get together for something like this.\"   During the past few months, McDowell has called many of his pitchers in an attempt to get to know their likes, dislikes and personality. Having worked in the Dodgers organization, he's not familiar with many of his new pitchers.   But he certainly knows Smoltz and understands how valuable it will be to have that kind of veteran around to help him ease into his role.   \"I'm excited just to see him work and be the pied piper of the pitching staff,\" McDowell said. \"Everybody knows the success he's had and when young guys see him work, it has an effect and often leads them to attempt to work just as hard.\"   While he was playing with the Dodgers in the early 1990s, McDowell had a chance to participate in a similar preseason throwing program. In fact, Mazzone began Camp Leo because he wanted his pitchers to have the same opportunity the Dodgers pitchers were getting.   But living in Florida at the time, McDowell chose to skip the event every year. Now that he's had time to reflect upon his career, he wishes he had chosen differently.   \"I never took advantage of anything like this,\" McDowell said. \"But looking back, it probably would have been something that would have been beneficial.\" Mark Bowman is a reporter for MLB.com.
