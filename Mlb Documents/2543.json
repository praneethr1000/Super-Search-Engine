    "body": "The Cubs signed right-hander Daniel Bard to a Minor League contract with an invitation to Major League Spring Training, the club confirmed Sunday. According to a WAPT Sports report, if Bard makes the big league club, his base salary would be $1 million plus incentives based on appearances for 2015. He would likely be used as a reliever in Chicago. Bard, once a highly regarded prospect as a first-round Draft pick in 2006, pitched in 211 games with the Red Sox from 2009-13, posting a 3.67 ERA through 257 1\/3 innings. The 29-year-old made just four appearances with the Rangers' Class A Hickory affiliate last year before he was released. Chad Thornburg is a reporter for MLB.com.
