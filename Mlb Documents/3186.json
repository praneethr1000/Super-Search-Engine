    "body": "Developing their own players has long been a source of pride for the Rays. Over the next few days, the club will move toward retaining some of its top homegrown talent.  Three of Tampa Bay's five unsigned arbitration-eligible players came through its system -- B.J. Upton, Jeff Niemann and David Price. On Friday, that trio joined relievers Burke Badenhop and J.P. Howell in formally filing for salary arbitration.  In all, the Major League Baseball Players Association announced 142 players league-wide had filed for salary arbitration overall. The arbitration filing period ran from Jan. 5 until Friday, with Tuesday set as the day for salary arbitration figures to be exchanged. Those players and teams that have hearings will engage in that process from Feb. 1-21 in St. Petersburg.   Upton will see his salary increase from the $4.825 million he made in 2011. Price, the All-Star left-hander, opted out of the final year of his original six-year contract to become arbitration-eligible. Niemann, another key member of the rotation, made $903,000 in 2011.   Howell, a lefty out of the bullpen, made $1.1 million last year. Badenhop, a right-handed reliever, earned $750,000 with the Marlins last season.   The Rays acquired Badenhop from Miami in December for Minor League catcher Jake Jefferies.  Joe Frisaro is a reporter for MLB.com. He writes a blog, called The Fish Pond.
