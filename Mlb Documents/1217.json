    "body": "The Rockies have agreed to a Minor League deal with veteran right-hander Miguel Batista and invited him to Spring Training, ESPN Deportes reported on Saturday night. The club has not commented on the deal, which would give Batista a chance to play in his 19th big league season. Colorado would be the 12th franchise for Batista, who turns 42 on Feb. 19. The Dominican Republic native pitched in 30 games and started five for the Mets last season before his release on July 26, then he logged five more relief appearances for the Braves. Overall, Batista went 1-3 with a 4.61 ERA, 36 strikeouts and 33 walks across 52 2\/3 innings in 2012. Batista has bounced between the rotation and bullpen throughout his career, appearing in 248 games as a starter and 410 as a reliever. He owns a career 102-115 record, a 4.48 ERA and marks of 5.8 strikeouts and 4.1 walks per nine innings. Andrew Simon is a contributor to MLB.com.
