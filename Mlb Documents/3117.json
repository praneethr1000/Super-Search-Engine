    "body": "A sense of renewal, hopes for fresh starts and new beginnings. The turn of the calendar from one year to another presents people with the opportunity to right wrongs and to leap from wayward tracks back on the straight and narrow.  This abstract pull is strongest for folks in baseball, which feels a natural rebirth in January anyway. New Year's Day is the sport's hump day; finish the climb away from one season on one side, and begin approaching the next on the other. No one revels in a clean slate more than players for whom 2011 was a year lost to injury.  A significant number of Major League royalty went missing last season, and now hope to reign again, rewarded for months of rehab work in isolation. These aren't the only comeback stories to follow, perhaps not even the most compelling. Those include the likes of Buster Posey, Grady Sizemore, Minnesota's Joe Mauer and Justin Morneau, and Ryan Howard, who blew out his Achilles on the Phillies' ultimate play of the year.
