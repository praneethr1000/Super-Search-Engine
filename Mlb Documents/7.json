    "body": "DENVER -- The Rockies were able to hang on to former first-round Draft pick Kyle Parker, a right-handed-hitting outfielder and first baseman, by outrighting him to Triple-A Albuquerque on Friday. Parker was designated for assignment on Jan. 20, and was not claimed by another club off waivers or traded, so the Rockies were able to keep him in the organization as a Minor League player and clear a spot on the 40-man Major League roster for outfielder Gerardo Parra, who signed a three-year, $27.5 million deal. Parker, 26, has hit .182 in 132 at-bats in the Majors over the last two seasons, and .285 with 24 home runs and 130 RBIs in 221 games over the last two years in Triple-A.
