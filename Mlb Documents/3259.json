    "body": "DENVER -- Third baseman Casey Blake made three trips to the disabled list in 2011 with the Dodgers, but he was effective enough in those brief periods of health to believe he could make a difference for a team in 2012.  Blake, 38, didn't have to look far for a team that needed a difference-maker at third. Blake stayed in the National League West by signing a one-year contract with the Rockies recently in hopes of being just that.  \"That's a big plus, being familiar with who you're playing, and I've played a lot of games at Coors Field,\" Blake said. \"For the first time in my career, I'm playing in a hitter-friendly park as my home park. To be able to add to an already potent lineup is going to be fun.\" Thomas Harding is a reporter for MLB.com. Read his blog, Hardball in the Rockies, and follow him on Twitter @harding_at_mlb.
