    "body": "SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. -- Major League Baseball's second in command said on Wednesday night that he was still \"guardedly optimistic\" that the U.S. Treasury Dept. will approve a reapplication for a license so Cuba can participate in the upcoming inaugural World Baseball Classic.  MLB filed the application on Dec. 22, a week after the Treasury Dept. denied the initial application, ostensibly on financial grounds, thus barring Cuba from the 16-team tournament that is currently scheduled from March 3-20 in the U.S., Japan and Puerto Rico.  \"We remain guardedly optimistic and are looking forward to receiving a positive response to our application,\" Bob DuPuy, MLB's president and chief operating officer, said after a meeting of the executive council during the first day of owners' meetings this week. \"Hopefully, in a matter of days.\" Barry M. Bloom is a national reporter for MLB.com. This story was not subject to the approval of Major League Baseball or its clubs.",
