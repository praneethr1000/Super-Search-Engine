    "body": "BOSTON -- While vacancies loom at shortstop and center field, the Red Sox can all but cross off first base as a spot of need.  Veteran first baseman J.T. Snow, one of the top defenders at his position, agreed to a one-year, $2 million contract with Boston.  The deal was announced late Friday night after Snow passed a physical. Though Snow will get his share of starts, Kevin Youkilis is expected to be Boston's primary first baseman. Snow still figures to see plenty of action, between late-inning defensive situations and pinch-hitting appearances.   The Red Sox are continuing a trend that started in July 2004, when they picked up defensive whiz Doug Mientkiewicz as a late-inning replacement and then got John Olerud to do that job in 2005.   The Sox had interest in bringing Olerud back for '06, but the sweet-swinging left-handed hitter opted instead to retire.   That left the Sox on the prowl for another left-handed-hitting first baseman with a top-notch glove, and Snow fit that mold perfectly.   Snow, who turns 38 next month and has six Gold Gloves, spent the last nine seasons with the San Francisco Giants. He hit .275 with four homers and 40 RBIs while getting 367 at-bats in 2005.   Two years ago, Snow hit a career-high .327 in 346 at-bats.      He has played 1,677 career games, hitting .268 with 189 homers and 873 RBIs.   Snow began his career with the Yankees in 1992, then moved to the Angels for the next four seasons. He went to San Francisco in 1997, and this move to the Red Sox will mark Snow's return to the American League. Ian Browne is a reporter for MLB.com.
