    "body": "Hall of Fame third baseman Brooks Robinson suffered a broken clavicle and another fracture to his rear shoulder area when he fell six to eight feet off a stage Friday night, according to the Palm Beach Post.  Robinson, 74, was sitting on an elevated stage at the Seminole Hard Rock Hotel and Casino in Hollywood, Fla., during a dinner for the Joe DiMaggio Legends Game, according to the Post. Robinson leaned back against a curtain toward the back of the stage, but there was nothing behind the curtain to hold him up.  \"After all the interviews were done, he leaned back, thinking there was a wall behind the curtain, but there was no wall,\" Johnny Elias, a retired bullpen catcher for the Montreal Expos, told the Post. \"He tumbled backwards and broke something. He could've broken his neck. He fell back about six to eight feet. One of my friends who is a doctor went behind there to treat him.\" Robinson, who will turn 75 in May, sustained two fractures in the tumble, including the broken clavicle. He was reportedly taken to a nearby hospital to be evaluated further and did not attend Saturday's Legends Game.   \"I understand he is doing fine, but I really don't know any more details other than that happened,\" Kevin Janser, the executive vice president for the Joe DiMaggio Children's Hospital Foundation, told the Post on Saturday.
