    "body": "DETROIT -- Many words have been written about Justin Upton's agreement with the Tigers. His new teammate, left-hander Daniel Norris, summed up the mood with no words at all. All Norris needed, in fact, were exclamation points. !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Barring an issue with his physical exam, Upton is expected to be introduced at Comerica Park on Wednesday afternoon, the same day several players fly into town ahead of the Tigers' annual Winter Caravan on Thursday and Friday. A few of them didn't wait to react as news emerged of the deal Monday night. Norris was among the first. Justin Verlander chimed in around the same time. He, too, was at a loss for words.   https:\/\/t.co\/uKqMBdNnFN J.D. Martinez had a similar reaction.   https:\/\/t.co\/cRRIQtM0r6 By the end of the evening, the realization set in. Catcher James McCann joined in Tuesday morning.  Could hardly sleep last night after that @tigers breaking news... #GoTigers So did Jordan Zimmermann, whose five-year, $110 million contract had been the largest deal for a Tiger this offseason. He woke up at home in chilly Wisconsin looking forward even more to Spring Training.  Wifi froze up yesterday with the cold weather but woke up to some really good news. #highofnegative2 #gotigers #whatalineup By midday, Verlander was thanking the owner.  I hope everyone appreciates what a great owner Mr. Illitch is!! This is the year! #tigers #2016 Jason Beck is a reporter for MLB.com.
