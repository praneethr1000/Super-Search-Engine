    "body": "ARLINGTON -- Rangers outfielder Leonys Martin met with new hitting coach Dave Magadan this week at the Ballpark in Arlington. Martin was one of five players who came in to get acquainted with Magadan.  The others were infielders Jurickson Profar and Mike Olt, outfielder Engel Beltre and catcher Jorge Alfaro. All five are among the Rangers' top Minor League position player prospects. \"Today was the last day. I was just acquainting myself with the younger players,\" Magadan said Wednesday. \"We had five guys in here -- a couple guys I've never seen before in person other than video -- so a chance for me to develop a relationship with them, so when Spring Training comes around, we'll hit the ground running and you don't really have to establish that at that point.\" ",
