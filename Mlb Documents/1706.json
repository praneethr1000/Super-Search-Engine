    "subtitle": "",
    "body": "The Rays have agreed to a one-year contract with second baseman Kelly Johnson, according to a report by FoxSports.com. The Rays have not commented on or confirmed the report. Ken Rosenthal and Jon Morosi reported Monday that the 30-year-old Johnson will join the Rays after spending last season with the Blue Jays. He broke into the big leagues with the Braves in 2005, signed with the D-backs before the 2010 season and was traded to Toronto in 2011. Johnson is a career .255 hitter, despite batting just .225 last season. He hit 16 homers and drove in 55 runs in 142 games for the Blue Jays in 2012. Rosenthal also tweeted that Rays utility man Ben Zobrist will play \"a lot\" of second base for Tampa Bay, while Johnson will serve more of a utility role. â€ªJoey Nowak is a reporter for MLB.com.
