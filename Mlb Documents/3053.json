    "body": "DENVER -- Right-handed pitcher Tyler Chatwood spent most of last season in the Majors at 21, some say before his time. But after being acquired by the Rockies in a trade with the Angels last month, Chatwood suddenly finds himself with pitchers close to his age, all trying to prove that young is not too young.  The pitcher the Rockies hope will be the ace of rotation, Jhoulys Chacin, turns 24 on Saturday. Left-hander Drew Pomeranz and right-hander Alex White, who arrived in the Ubaldo Jimenez trade with the Indians last year, will be 23 when the season starts. With lefty Jorge De La Rosa missing most or all of the first half as he recovers from elbow surgery, no healthy starter on the current 40-man roster has reached his 30th birthday.  But as this potential rotation stands, Chatwood, who turned 22 last month, suddenly isn't a baby-faced anomaly. Thomas Harding is a reporter for MLB.com.
