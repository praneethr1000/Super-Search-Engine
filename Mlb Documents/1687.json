    "body": "ANAHEIM -- The Angels settled on a 2013 contract with relief pitcher Kevin Jepsen on Tuesday, thus avoiding arbitration with any of their eligible players. Jepsen, who was in his first year of arbitration, will make $1,181,250 in 2013. When the two sides exchanged figures on Jan. 18, the 28-year-old asked for $1.4 million and the Angels countered with $975,000. Knee surgery cut Jepsen's season short in 2011. But by the end of 2012, the hard-throwing right-hander had found his groove and returned to a prominent role in the Angels' bullpen, finishing with a 3.02 ERA and a 1.14 WHIP in 44 2\/3 innings. Over his last 26 2\/3 innings, spanning the final two months of the season, he gave up six earned runs, struck out 24 batters and walked eight. Jason Vargas ($8.5 million), Tommy Hanson ($3.725 million) and Jerome Williams ($2 million) previously avoided arbitration. Third baseman Alberto Callaspo recently agreed to terms on a two-year, $8.975 million contract that will buy out his first season of free agency and will be finalized as soon as he flies in from Venezuela for his physical.
