    "body": "KANSAS CITY -- A night game on Opening Day is not all that unusual for the Royals.  Their 9:05 p.m. CT launch on April 6 at Anaheim will mark the eighth night opener in the Royals' 44 seasons. Of the previous seven, three also came on the Angels' home turf.  The Royals won, 4-1, in 1971, but the next two times the Angels threw a fella named Nolan Ryan and won both games by 3-2 scores in 1973 and 1975. Each time Ryan pitched a complete game, each time he struck out 12 and each time Steve Busby started for the Royals. In '75, John Mayberry's solo home run gave the Royals a 2-1 lead that evaporated in the ninth with an Angels rally. So 2012 will mark the Royals' fourth opener at Anaheim, all of them night games.   The other night opener on the road was in 1992 at Oakland, a 5-3 loss. That was also the last nighttime season launch for the Royals.   The season began three times with night games in Kansas City -- 1974, a 6-4 loss in 11 innings to Minnesota; 1979, an 11-2 victory over Toronto; and 1980, a 5-1 loss to Detroit.   That gives the Royals a 2-5 record when they start the season with a night game.",
