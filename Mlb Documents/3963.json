    "body": "The Red Sox completed a one-year contract with free-agent outfielder Cody Ross on Thursday. The one-year deal is reportedly worth $3 million, plus possible bonuses based on the amount of plate appearances he makes.  To make room for Ross on the 40-man roster, the Red Sox designated right-hander Scott Atchison for assignment. Ross, who turned 31 in December, hit .240 with 14 home runs and 52 RBIs during the 2011 season with the San Francisco Giants.  A postseason hero for the Giants during their World Series championship run in 2010, Ross will give the Red Sox some depth in the outfield, with Carl Crawford not expected to be ready before the start of the season and Mike Aviles likely to play more at shortstop than expected.
