    "body": "CINCINNATI -- All of the recent trade rumors surrounding Reds right fielder Austin Kearns appear to be doused for the time being.  Kearns' name has run rampant in media reports all week since new owner\/chief executive officer Robert Castellini dismissed general manager Dan O'Brien and named baseball operations director Brad Kullman the team's interim GM.  Kullman spent the past couple of days huddling with top advisors from the baseball operations staff, and the consensus of the group was that Kearns should stay unless there's an overwhelming offer. Meanwhile, Kullman said that he's continuing to talk with other clubs about making any potential deals.   Mark Sheldon is a reporter for MLB.com.
