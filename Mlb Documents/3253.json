    "body": "CLEVELAND -- The Indians added some organizational depth on Friday, signing a trio of players to Minor League contracts.  Cleveland inked infielders Chin-Lung Hu and Argenis Reyes and right-hander Willy Lebron to Minors deals that do not include invitations to attend Spring Training with the Major League team. All three players will report to Minor League camp this spring.  The 27-year-old Hu has spent parts of five seasons in the big leagues between stints with the Dodgers and Mets. Last year, Hu went just 1-for-20 with New York before being sent outright to Triple-A Buffalo. Hu, who has experience at shortstop and second base, has a .296 career average in the Minor Leagues, but he hit just .161 across three levels in 2011. Reyes, 29, began the 2011 season with the New Jersey Jackals of the Canadian-American Association before signing with Triple-A Columbus in early August. Reyes is a second baseman by trade, but he has experience at six positions. He hit .306 in 60 games with New Jersey and followed that showing by hitting .313 in 25 games for Columbus. Reyes has played professionally for nine seasons and appeared in big league games with the Mets in 2008-09.   The 31-year-old Lebron spent the 2011 season within the Royals' system, appearing in 32 games between tours with Double-A Northwest Arkansas and Triple-A Omaha. Lebron went a combined 4-2 with a 3.02 ERA over 65 2\/3 innings, in which he struck out 72 and walked 31. Lebron did not play professionally from 2007-10, but he has previous experience in the organizations of the Rangers, Reds and Cubs.",
