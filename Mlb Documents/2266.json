    "body": "Baseball legend and Atlanta icon Hank Aaron is part of a group hoping to purchase the Atlanta Hawks, according to a report by ESPN.com. The group is spearheaded by Memphis Grizzles minority owner and vice chairman Steve Kaplan, Indonesian billionaire sports and media magnates Erick Thohir and Handy Poernomo Soetedjo, and former Grizzlies CEO Jason Levien, who is the current managing general partner of DC United in Major League Soccer. Aaron's history with the city and his affection for the Hawks is said to be a major reason for his desire to join the group of bidders, which also includes a few other prominent Atlantans. After a historic career that saw him slug 755 home runs, Aaron, a 1982 Hall of Fame inductee, has spent the last several decades as a baseball executive and a business owner of several car dealerships and restaurants.
