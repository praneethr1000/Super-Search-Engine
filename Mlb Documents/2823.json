    "body": "Venezuelan Winter League Caribes 5, Magallanes 3, 10 innings Caribes was facing elimination via a four-game sweep in the Championship Series, trailing 3-0 entering the bottom of the 10th inning after nine scoreless frames Sunday night. But after loading the bases and cutting Magallanes' lead to 3-2 on a two-run double by Hector Gimenez, Twins shortstop Eduardo Escobar ended the game in hugely dramatic fashion, hitting a walk-off three-run homer that allowed Caribes to survive for another game. Box score Mexican Pacific League Hermosillo 6, Navojoa 4 Hermosillo took a 3-2 lead in the Championship Series with a big win on the road, and it did most of the damage early, putting up five runs in the first inning and holding on for dear life the rest of the way. Jerry Owens and Carlos Alberto Gastelum struck the biggest blows for the winning club, homering back to back to start the game. Former big leaguer Barry Enright went 5 2\/3 innings and gave up four runs in the win, and Angels reliever Fernando Salas earned the save. Box score Dominican Winter League Escogido 9, Licey 6 Escogido squandered an early 6-0 lead but scored once in the eighth inning and twice in the ninth to put this one away and tie the best-of-nine Championship Series at three games apiece. Escogido has all the momentum, however, having won the past three in the set after losing the first three. Jesus Feliciano was the star for the winning team, going 2-for-3 with two walks and four RBIs. Escogido overcame a huge game from former big leaguer Lew Ford, who had two home runs and three RBIs. Pirates prospect Gregory Polanco drew four walks and scored three times for Escogido. Box score Puerto Rican Liga de Beisbol Profesional Roberto Clemente Mayaguez 5, Caguas 1 With the victory, Mayaguez wrapped up the Championship Series, 4-2, to head to the Caribbean Series. The game was deadlocked at 1 in the bottom of the eighth inning, when Jose De La Torre walked the bases loaded and Kennys Vargas emptied them with one swing, essentially a series-winning grand slam. Martin Maldonado had the other RBI for Mayaguez, and Jorge Martinez earned the win with eight innings of one-run, 10-strikeout ball. Box score Doug Miller is a reporter for MLB.com.
