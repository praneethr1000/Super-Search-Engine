    "body": "DENVER -- Disturbing the peace charges in Oxford, Miss., against Rockies rookie left-handed pitcher Drew Pomeranz have been dropped, his representatives announced Friday. Pomeranz, 23, who played college baseball at Ole Miss in Oxford, was arrested early on Oct. 15 after leaving a bar with his friends. The Beverly Hills Sports Council made the announcement via Twitter that charges had been dropped, after communicating with the pitcher's lawyer. A Rockies official acknowledged that they had been informed the charges were dropped, but declined to comment further. Pomeranz is scheduled to be at the Rockies' fan festival next weekend. Pomeranz tweeted Friday, \"Focused on baseball & looking forward to ST [Spring Training].\"  The centerpiece in the trade that sent former Rockies ace Ubaldo Jimenez to the Indians last season, Pomeranz will compete for a spot in the Rockies' rotation this year and is considered to have star potential.  The Rockies called up Pomeranz at the end of last season, and he went 2-1 with a 5.40 ERA in four starts.  Thomas Harding is a reporter for MLB.com.
