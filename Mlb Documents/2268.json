    "body": "MIAMI -- Dan Haren is willing to report to Spring Training with the Marlins, but has the 34-year-old right-hander bought into being with the club? That remains unclear. According to the Miami Herald, Haren still is hopeful of being traded to a West Coast club to be closer to his family in California. However, the lack of resolution of the matter continues to complicate what has become one of the more confusing transactions in recent team history. The Marlins acquired Haren from the Dodgers on Dec. 10 as part of the Dee Gordon trade. At the time, Miami knew the pitcher's preference was to pitch for a club in the American League West or the National League West. To guard against not having Haren's services, the Marlins negotiated that the Dodgers would cover the $10 million owed to the pitcher. If Haren retires or is traded, Miami still would receive cash considerations from Los Angeles, believed to be $10 million. In late December, Haren informed the Marlins that he still wanted to pitch out west, and the team has explored trade options. But in recent days, MLB.com learned that Haren was considering reporting with Miami. FoxSports.com reported Sunday night that Haren indeed plans on attending Spring Training, which opens for the Marlins on Feb. 20 at the Roger Dean Stadium complex in Jupiter, Fla. The Herald on Sunday night reported Haren plans on traveling to Jupiter, but the paper said he has again asked Miami to seek a trade. The Marlins have not commented on Haren's situation. If Haren's hope is to still be traded, it would differ from what MLB.com had learned on Saturday, which was that the right-hander was ready to not just report, but also to pitch for Miami. It's also unclear what would happen if Haren reports and a trade isn't consummated. Would the 34-year-old step away and say he is retiring? From the Marlins' perspective, they want Haren as part of their rotation. If he isn't, the club would remain in the market for a veteran. Haren is coming off a 13-11 season with a 4.02 ERA and a WHIP of 1.18 in 186 innings with the Dodgers. The Marlins' rotation currently is Mat Latos, Henderson Alvarez, Jarred Cosart and either Tom Koehler, Brad Hand or David Phelps. If Haren steps in, the starting five immediately would be upgraded.
