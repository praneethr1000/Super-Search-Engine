    "body": "MINNEAPOLIS -- The Twins added another option for a left-handed reliever on Monday by signing Darrell May to a Minor League contract with an invitation to Spring Training.  May, 33, is the most recent pitcher with Major League experience to be inked to a Minor League deal with the Twins. Dennys Reyes and Gabe White also will compete with May in Spring Training for the spot in the bullpen left open by the departure of J.C. Romero.  A starter for the Kansas City Royals from 2002-04, May began last season with San Diego where he was 1-3 with a 5.61 ERA in 22 appearances (eight starts). He was then shipped to the Yankees in July. May's struggles continued there, as he went 0-1 with a 16.71 ERA in two appearances. Kelly Thesier  is a reporter for MLB.com.
