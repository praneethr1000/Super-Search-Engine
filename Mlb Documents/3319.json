    "body": "MILWAUKEE -- The Brewers claimed 25-year-old infielder Jeff Bianchi off waivers from the Cubs on Wednesday, a move to bolster the organization's relatively thin middle-infield corps.  Bianchi was with the Cubs only a month, having been previously waived by the Royals. He was Kansas City's second-round Draft pick in 2005, and is a career .281 hitter with a .335 on-base percentage in six Minor League seasons. Bianchi missed the 2010 season after undergoing Tommy John surgery on his right elbow during Spring Training.  He returned in 2011 and batted .259 with two home runs, 48 RBIs and 20 stolen bases in 119 games at Double-A Northwest Arkansas. Adam McCalvy is a reporter for MLB.com.
