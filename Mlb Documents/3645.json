    "body": "CLEVELAND -- The Indians were blindsided by Thursday's news that the pitcher known to date as Fausto Carmona was arrested in the Dominican Republic for using a false identity. Cleveland is now scrambling to determine how to handle the situation.  The pitcher's real name was reported to be Roberto Hernandez Heredia.  \"We were recently made aware of the situation that occurred today in the Dominican Republic,\" Indians general manager Chris Antonetti said in a statement, \"and are currently in the process of gathering information. We are not prepared to make any additional comment at this time.\" Jordan Bastian is a reporter for MLB.com. Read his blog, Major League Bastian, and follow him on Twitter @MLBastian.
