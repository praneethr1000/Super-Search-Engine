    "body": "CLEVELAND -- The Indians took care of the first of their arbitration-eligible players by signing reliever David Riske to a one-year contract worth $1.8 million late Monday. The right-handed Riske will be back in the bullpen mix after going 3-4 with a 3.10 ERA and one save in 58 appearances in 2005. Riske, 29, recorded the 11th lowest batting average among American League relievers at .208. In his 72 2\/3 innings of work, he held first batters to a .151 average, which ranked fourth lowest in the AL. Anthony Castrovince is a reporter for MLB.com.
