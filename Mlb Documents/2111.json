    "body": "ARLINGTON -- The Rangers avoided an arbitration hearing with pitcher Ross Detwiler by agreeing to a one-year, $3.45 million contract on Friday. First baseman Mitch Moreland is the Rangers' only remaining potential arbitration case. The two sides are $600,000 apart on Moreland. He is requesting $3.35 million from arbitration, while the Rangers are offering $2.75 million. Moreland made $2.65 million last season when he played in just 52 games and hit .246 with two home runs and 23 RBIs. He missed the final four months of the season because of surgery on his left ankle. Hearings will be scheduled for February. The Rangers are hopeful of avoiding a hearing with Moreland, and they haven't had one with a player since 2000. Detwiler was acquired from the Nationals in December, and he goes into Spring Training as one of the club's five projected starters. He was used as a reliever by the Nats in 2014. Detwiler went 2-3 with a 4.00 ERA in a career-high 47 appearances for Washington in 2014, the first time in his Major League career he had pitched exclusively in relief. He has a career record of 20-32 with a 3.82 ERA over 132 games, including 69 starts in the big leagues. In '12, he established career highs in wins (10), starts (27), and innings (164 1\/3) before being sidelined much of '13 with a lower back strain. T.R. Sullivan is a reporter for MLB.com.
