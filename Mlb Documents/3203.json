    "body": "Center fielder Colby Rasmus has agreed to a $2.7 million contract with the Blue Jays for 2012, thereby avoiding arbitration.  Toronto acquired Rasmus in a midseason trade with St. Louis, and the Blue Jays are hoping the 25-year-old left-handed hitter can rebound after a rough introduction to the American League.  Rasmus was batting .246 with 11 homers in 94 games with the Cardinals before being involved in the eight-player trade days prior to the Trade Deadline. With the Blue Jays, Rasmus batted .173 in 35 games, with three homers. Tom Singer is a national reporter for MLB.com. Follow @Tom_Singer on Twitter.
