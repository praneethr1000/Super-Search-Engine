    "body": "One super sub apparently isn't enough for the Mariners, who signed veteran Miguel Cairo on Tuesday to a one-year contract.  \"Miguel strengthens our bench by giving us another player, along with Willie Bloomquist, who can cover all four infield spots and, in a pinch, the corners of the outfield,\" general manager Bill Bavasi said in a release. \"This should allow [manager John McLaren] more flexibility to use Miguel or Willie earlier in a game, if he wants, and still be covered late.\"  Bloomquist is regarded as one of the best backups in the Major Leagues, playing seven positions last season, including starts at five of them -- second base, third base, shortstop, left field and center field. He also has postseason experience, appearing in the 2001 and '02 playoffs with the Cardinals and 2004 and '06 with the Yankees. Cairo has .348 batting average (8-for-23) in nine Division Series games, and .316 (12-for-38) in 10 career Championship Series contests.    Jim Street is a reporter for MLB.com.
