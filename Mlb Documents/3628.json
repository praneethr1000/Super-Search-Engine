    "body": "SAN FRANCISCO -- Tim Lincecum and the Giants are edging closer to a contract agreement that would enable the parties to avoid a potentially divisive salary arbitration hearing. Industry sources confirmed Friday that negotiations between the club and Lincecum have progressed since Tuesday, when they exchanged proposed figures for one-year contracts. Lincecum requested $21.5 million, $500,000 short of the record amount Houston's Roger Clemens sought in 2005. The Giants countered with $17 million, the largest arbitration offer a team ever has made. It was not known whether the sides were discussing a one-year contract, which Lincecum said last season he'd prefer, or a multiyear deal, such as the two-year, $23 million pact he agreed to minutes before he and the Giants were scheduled to launch an arbitration hearing last year.
