    "body": "Given the relative recent fortunes of the Major League's two circuits, one would expect National League teams to be ready to consult Dr. Phil.  In the era of American League supremacy, the NL has to hear all about losing 11 straight All-Star Games, losing seven of the last 10 World Series (and 34 of the last 50 World Series games), losing Interleague Series, even losing marquee players.  However, in at least one instance the NL can proudly step up to the plate. Or, rather, squat behind it: When it comes to the new generation of catchers, NL clubs are ahead of the curve. Blessed are the teams able to count on an undisputed No. 1. But becoming more prevalent are teams counting on catching tandems, hoping to exploit the individual assets of multiple receivers.           Tom Singer is a reporter for MLB.com.
