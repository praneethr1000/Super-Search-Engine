    "body": "Right-handers Gerrit Cole and Jameson Taillon, firmly locked in as the Pirates' top two prospects for a second consecutive year, both received invitations on Thursday to the club's Major League Spring Training camp.  The Bucs also extended Spring Training invitations to a pair of freshly-signed Minor League free agents, one with extensive big league experience. Outfielder Brad Hawpe and catcher Lucas May signed Minor League deals.  This will be a return to Pirate City for Cole, who got his professional feet wet in Bradenton last year prior to a season in which he ascended from Class A to Triple-A. The No. 1 overall choice in the 2011 First-Year Player Draft went an aggregate 9-7 with a 2.80 ERA in Bradenton, Double-A Altoona and Triple-A Indianapolis.
