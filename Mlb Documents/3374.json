    "body": "HOUSTON -- Ed Wade was dealing with some quadriceps tightness Monday as he went up and down the stairs at Minute Maid Park, but the Astros' general manager was otherwise no worse for the wear after completing the Houston Marathon on Sunday.  Wade, who turned 55 on Monday, ran the 26.2-mile course in 4 hours, 39 minutes, 3 seconds -- about 10 minutes faster than the time in which he finished the Marine Corps Marathon in 2007. The completion of the event was the culmination of months of training while juggling the duties of his job.  \"I enjoyed doing it,\" he said. \"It was a good goal to work towards and it got me back in shape. The atmosphere was good and there were tons of people out there supporting the runners. Other than my right calf barking at me at mile 20, it was pretty good.\" Wade was among thousands of runners who battled rainy and humid conditions to finish the winding course through the streets of downtown Houston. Wade ran at a pace of 10 minutes, 39 seconds per mile, which included short intervals of walking.   \"The rain wasn't that big of a deal,\" Wade said. \"It was a little bit humid and warm, but it wasn't anything that was insurmountable. You're never going to have perfect conditions, but the way the course sets up and the way they managed it was good.\"   Wade said he was on a pace to finish in about 4 hours, 20 minutes before his right calf began to cramp, which led to him taking more walking breaks and slowing it down a little bit.   \"I would have been happy with that time and improve over the time I had in '07,\" he said. \"But I ran it to finish, and I finished.\"   Wade has been running since he began his baseball career as a public relations intern with the Astros in 1977, and he ran his first marathon in 2007 to honor the memory of a Marine who was killed in the line of duty. Last year, he was watching the Houston Marathon from the steps of his apartment when he saw Astros employees Allen Rowin and Jonathan Germer run past. That gave him motivation to run it himself this year.   Said Wade: \"To see the atmosphere and see how people on the side are into it and encouraging the runners, I said, 'I think I can do this.'\"   Wade's biggest supporters Sunday were monitoring his progress mile by mile on the Internet -- his wife Roxanne in suburban Philadelphia and his two daughters and his son Ryan from different locations around the country.   \"[My wife] encourages me to do it,\" Wade said. \"She certainly doesn't dissuade me to do it. She knows how happy I am to compete and finish. She was my first call when I finished. She was back in New Jersey doing the snow-shoveling marathon this winter. The way the Houston Marathon sets it up, they can follow runners online by bib number. Ryan and the girls were receiving text messages throughout and Roxanne was looking online.\"   Wade said he's considering trying to run in the San Diego Marathon, which takes place next June while the Astros are in town to play the Padres. That's if the demands of his job don't get in the way.   \"When the season starts, things get haywire, but that gives me a goal to shoot for,\" Wade said.
