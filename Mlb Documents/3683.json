    "body": "Cuban left-hander Gerardo Concepcion established residence in Mexico and is closer to becoming a Major League free agent, according to an ESPN report on Wednesday.  Concepcion's agent, Jaime Torres, told ESPN that Concepcion is now a resident of Mexico and is working out in the Dominican Republic. He could begin negotiating with big league clubs soon.  Concepcion defected from Cuba last June during the World Port Tournament in the Netherlands, which is the same tournament where Reds left-hander Aroldis Chapman defected in 2009. The 18-year-old Concepcion was named Rookie of the Year in the Cuban Serie Nacional in 2010-11 after posting a 10-3 record and a 3.36 ERA in 21 games with Industriales de la Habana.   The White Sox and Cubs are among several clubs interested in signing the left-hander. Rhett Bollinger is a reporter for MLB.com.
