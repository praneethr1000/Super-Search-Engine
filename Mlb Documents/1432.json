    "body": "Brian Wilson may be switching coasts next season.  According to multiple reports, the bearded former Giants closer worked out privately for the Mets, who may be looking to add some bullpen depth behind Frank Francisco for the 2013 season.  Wilson, 30, underwent Tommy John surgery last April after just two appearances. Despite struggling through injuries during the second half of 2011, he still managed to rack up 36 saves for the Giants that year, along with a 3.11 ERA. Mets general manager Sandy Alderson watched Wilson's workout and told The New York Post he was \"not sure\" if the club would extend a contract offer to the right-hander, who posted a career 3.21 ERA with 340 strikeouts in 320 innings over his seven years in San Francisco.   Wilson was non-tendered by the Giants in November.    Gary Cotton is a reporter for MLB.com. This story was not subject to the approval of Major League Baseball or its clubs.",
