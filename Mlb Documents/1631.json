    "subtitle": "",
    "body": "There is an inauthenticity to Alex Rodriguez, and not just because he was exposed as a PED user four years ago or because he is now alleged to have continued using performance enhancers the last four seasons. To many, A-Rod (and yes, even the nickname leaves something to be desired) has long been viewed as too image-conscious, too vain, too insecure to be taken seriously as one of the game's all-timers. Somewhere alongside the glove-slapping incident against the Red Sox, the Cameron Diaz popcorn feeding, the Details Magazine photos of him kissing himself in the mirror, Rodriguez became more punchline than protagonist. Sign the two most lucrative contracts in the history of American professional sports, and you're bound to be intensely scrutinized. But A-Rod has always seemed to find strange ways to attract the spotlight. Rumors that he had a painting of himself depicted as a centaur hanging in his house certainly didn't help.
