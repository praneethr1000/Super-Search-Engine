    "body": "The Pirates have signed veteran outfielder Chris Dickerson to a Minor League contract with an invitation to Spring Training. Dickerson, a career .262 hitter in 314 Major League games, has played for the Reds, Brewers, Yankees and Orioles. Dickerson, a left-handed hitter, was originally drafted by Cincinnati in the 16th round of the 2003 First-Year Player Draft. He made his big league debut in the 2008 season and would go on to set career bests in games (97), doubles (13) and stolen bases (11) with the Reds in '09. Dickerson batted .238 (25-for-105) and played all three outfield spots last year with the Orioles, and he hit .243 with two home runs in 37 games with Triple-A Norfolk. After adding the 31-year-old Dickerson, the Pirates have invited 12 non-roster players to big league camp. Spencer Fordin is a reporter for MLB.com.
