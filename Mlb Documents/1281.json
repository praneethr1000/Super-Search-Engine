    "body": "CINCINNATI -- At Friday's deadline, the Reds and their six remaining players eligible for arbitration exchanged salary figures.  Starting pitcher Homer Bailey filed at $5.8 million, while the club offered $4.75 million. Bailey, 26, made $2.4 million during 2012, when he avoided arbitration for the first time.  Outfielder Shin-Soo Choo filed for $8 million. The club countered at 6.75 million. Choo, acquired in last month's trade with the Indians, made $4.9 million last season. This is his third and final time being eligible. The two sides were closer on the four remaining players.   Outfielder Chris Heisey is seeking $1.65 million, while the Reds offered $1.05 million. A Super Two player with enough service time, Heisey is going through the process for the first time after he made $495,000 in 2012.   Starting pitcher Mat Latos is seeking $4.7 million, while he was offered $4.15 million. Either way, Latos will get a large jump from the $550,000 he earned last season. He is first-time arbitration-eligible.   Starting pitcher Mike Leake is seeking $3.5 million and was countered with $2.65 million. Leake earned $507,000 last season and is eligible for the first time.   Alfredo Simon is seeking $1.05 million and the club returned with $750,000. A first-time eligible player, he made $487,000 last season.   Teams and players can continue negotiations, and Reds history indicates deals are usually worked out before a hearing. The Reds haven't gone to a hearing since 2004.   Hearings are scheduled anywhere between Feb. 4-20. Once the arbitrator makes the decision, it's binding and the player is automatically signed to a one-year contract at the ruled amount. Mark Sheldon is a reporter for MLB.com.
