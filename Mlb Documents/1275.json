    "body": "CHICAGO -- The Cubs avoided arbitration with Matt Garza, Jeff Samardzija and James Russell on Friday, which was a relief for the three pitchers as well as the team.  \"It's a big load off my mind,\" Garza said of his new $10.25 million deal. \"It's time to focus on what matters.\"  Samardzija agreed to a $2.64 million contract, which has additional player bonus money, and Russell signed for $1.075 million. This was the first time Samardzija and Russell were eligible for salary arbitration. Garza will be a free agent after this season, and there had been some discussion regarding a long-term deal, but he isn't thinking about that. Carrie Muskat is a reporter for MLB.com.
