    "body": "Well, here's a topic that comes up once or twice or 3,000 times every year in Major League Baseball, and especially on the slowest of slow days in January: The designated hitter -- yay or nay? If you're like me, and you have a Twitter feed dominated by baseball banter, you saw it emerge as a trending topic this week. And if you're like me, and you tend to flip on MLB Network's \"Hot Stove\" program, you saw it examined at length again Thursday. And even if you're not all that plugged in to baseball from a social media or cable standpoint, you might have at least seen that recent Volkswagen commercial in which the guy buying a Passat and the salesman spend more time arguing about the DH than they do haggling over the price of the car. A. It inspires passionate feelings on both sides of the equation   B. All those passionate exchanges have resulted in absolutely zero change to the respective rules of the American League and National League.   Oh, sure, maybe there was some slight chance of change in 1996, when MLB was preparing to initiate Interleague Play. At the time, there was thought that the AL might actually revert back to what had become known as the NL rules. But why in the world would the MLBPA sign off on any arrangement that would cause the elimination of 14 such prominent Major League jobs? It wasn't going to happen then, just as it's not going to happen now.                Anthony Castrovince is a reporter for MLB.com. Read his columns and follow him on Twitter at @Castrovince.
