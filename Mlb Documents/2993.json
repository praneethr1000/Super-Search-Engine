    "body": "This time of year, your place in the Major League hierarchy is dependent upon what comes post-prefix -- what remains after \"re.\" The best clubs are looking to repeat, the worst are looking to recover. And if you're resigned to the notion that 2012 isn't going to be your year, you reconnoiter as best you can. There has been some confusion, some consternation and some miscommunication over what \"re\" the Chicago White Sox are living by these days. General manager Kenny Williams used the dreaded \"rebuilding\" at the Winter Meetings, only to be countered by his newly hired manager, Robin Ventura, who offered \"retooling.\" A series of swaps and signings by the Sox in recent weeks echoes that back-and-forth, as a John Danks extension didn't exactly fit the profile conjured up by the deals that have sent Sergio Santos, Carlos Quentin and Jason Frasor packing.  Whatever this is -- a rebuild or a retool -- it's a reminder of just how hard the Sox fell in 2011. And the result is a club that will undoubtedly be a lot younger, a little cheaper and far from a sexy pick to contend in 2012.  That last point, by the way, hardly bothers the Sox.  \"We've been picked numerous times and didn't win,\" Williams will remind you.  He's right, of course. And an American League Central in which we might be just a Tiger injury or two away from total unpredictability is a good place to be when you're going young.  But for the White Sox to be here, selling off any commodities not tied down with a burdensome contract or a no-trade clause, is a testament to all the disastrous deals that did them in. Last year's payroll approached $130 million, but the Sox barely sniffed .500.  Williams is free of what had become a comical power struggle with Ozzie Guillen, but he still has his hands full of contractual gambles gone wrong. Adam Dunn, Jake Peavy and Alex Rios will combine to make $43 million this year, and that's a big reason why the Sox -- even after these recent cost-cutting swaps -- already have a little more than $100 million committed to their current roster. None of those guys are going anywhere, and neither are captain Paul Konerko or catcher A.J. Pierzynski, both of whom have trade protection.  If the Sox merely had 2012 payroll outlays to worry about, that would be one thing. But they already have at least $76.75 million committed to eight players in 2013, according to data on mlbcontracts.blogspot.com (and that includes the expected $4 million buyout of Peavy's 2013 option).  Blowing it all up would be the ideal move at this juncture, but it's not a serious option because of those outlandish obligations. Hence, the seemingly mixed messages that have come from the higher-ups.  \"It's not a traditional rebuild,\" Williams has said.  No, it's not. The Sox will try to toe a tricky line in '12. They'll try to contend and cut costs simultaneously -- a balancing act that rarely works, unless you have the right young pieces.  Whether the Sox have those is a matter very much in question.  The White Sox lack of upper-level rotation depth in the Minors was well-documented, which is why they targeted Nestor Molina in the Santos swap with the Blue Jays and Simon Castro and Pedro Hernandez in the Quentin trade with the Padres. Molina put up ridiculous numbers (148 strikeouts against 16 walks in 130 1\/3 innings) in High-A and Double-A last year, while Castro is a top-prospect-turned-wayward-project and Hernandez is a command lefty.  None of them are Major League-ready, but at least the Sox (who also brought in Zach Stewart when they initially acquired Frasor from Toronto last summer before sending him back this winter) have something they didn't have mere months ago: inventory. Perhaps, most important of all will be the development of Chris Sale in a starting role -- a role, you could argue, he should have transitioned to a year ago.  The decision to not only retain but extend Danks might have raised an eyebrow or three, given Williams' \"rebuilding\" declaration that preceded the signing. But when you remember that Danks is only 26, had the potential to see his free-agent price tag skyrocket next winter and was attracting only lukewarm interest on the trade market, the five-year, $65 million contract might be money well spent. No matter where the rebuilding or retooling or whatever goes from here, the Sox will maintain a need for dependable, affordable starting pitching.  With Mark Buehrle departed, there's probably not enough pitching here to keep the Sox afloat in the standings. Especially when you remember they'll once again have to find somebody to close out games, now that Santos was dealt mere weeks after signing a long-term extension. Maybe you give that job to Matt Thornton, who fumbled it last year. But he, too, is considered trade bait at this juncture.  Offensively, this is not an inspiring club. They were 11th in the AL in runs scored (654) and OPS (.706) last year, and the run-production obviously isn't aided by Quentin's departure.  Konerko has been an ageless wonder and Alexei Ramirez is one of the game's best shortstops, but the accolades give way to if-comes and head shakes from there. You don't bet on Dunn hitting a buck-sixty again, but you don't pencil him in for his once-customary 40 homers, either. You wonder if Rios will give Ventura as many sleepless nights as he did Guillen. And you wonder if the 25-year-old Gordon Beckham's 2009 season was a flash in the pan.  There has been growing speculation that the Sox are slashing dollars in an effort to clear room for Cuban sensation Yoenis Cespedes in center field. If that's the plan, it's a confusing one. This club buried itself with contractual risks gone wrong, and the unproven Cespedes, who has hundreds of thousands of hits on YouTube but none in the big leagues, will be an awfully big risk at anywhere from $30 million to $50 million.  With or without Cespedes, you'd be hard-pressed to call this club's contention hopes realistic. And with so many veterans still under bulky contracts, you'd be hard-pressed to call them a rebuilder, too.  The Sox are somewhere in between. And theirs is a situation far from resplendent.
