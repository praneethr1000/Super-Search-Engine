    "body": "CINCINNATI -- The final item on the Reds' offseason wish list -- a backup infielder who can play shortstop -- appeared to be checked off on Wednesday.  Bypassing what was a picked over free-agent market, Cincinnati executed a trade that brought utility infielder Wilson Valdez from the Phillies for left-handed reliever Jeremy Horst.  The Reds also announced that right-handed setup reliever Nick Masset avoided arbitration by signing a two-year contract for $5.5 million. The deal, according to The Associated Press, is worth $2.4 million for 2012 and $3.1 million for '13, and it includes performance bonuses for the '13 salary if he reaches certain goals.
