    "body": "SAN DIEGO -- It will be a busy two-day stretch for the Padres, who are hunkered down in their Petco Park offices, trying to come to terms with their eight arbitration-eligible players.  Make that seven players now, as the Padres have come to terms on a 2013 contract with outfielder Will Venable. Venable will make $2.675 million this season after making $1.475 million in 2012.  Venable, 30, hit .264 last season with nine home runs, 45 RBIs and 24 stolen bases in 417 at-bats. He'll likely split time in right field as part of a left-right platoon with the right-handed-hitting Chris Denorfia. In parts of five Major League seasons, all with the Padres, Venable has a .253\/.324\/.415 line.   The Padres' remaining arbitration-eligible players include catcher John Baker, shortstop Everth Cabrera, third baseman Chase Headley and pitchers Luke Gregerson, Joe Thatcher, Clayton Richard and Edinson Volquez. All of those players filed for salary arbitration on Tuesday.   The 133 Major League players who filed and their respective clubs will exchange 2013 salary proposals by Friday.   Arbitration hearings will be scheduled to take place Feb. 4-20, though players and clubs can reach deals before then to avoid what can be an uncomfortable process.   In November, the Padres and first baseman\/outfielder Kyle Blanks avoided arbitration by agreeing to a $605,000 deal for 2013.    Corey Brock is a reporter for MLB.com.
