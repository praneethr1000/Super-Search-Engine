    "body": "The lawyer for Cubs closer Carlos Marmol said his client is innocent of an accusation of abuse against a woman in the Dominican Republic. Nelson Pimentel spoke to the Chicago Tribune on Thursday denying the charges first detailed in a story by Dominican newspaper website LinstinDiario.com. Marmol and his lawyers have accused the woman of trying to extort and blackmail Marmol and have filed a counter-complaint. \"Carlos Marmol is totally innocent of the things he is accused of. They never occurred. She is only trying to get money out of Carlos Marmol,\" Pimentel said. \"It is very important for us to say the legal case against him is not true.\" According to LisinDiario's report, Marmol has yet to be charged by Dominican police. Marmol, 30, has spent his entire seven-year career with the Cubs. Last season, Marmol notched a 3.42 ERA along with 20 saves and 72 strikeouts in his 61 appearances. The former All-Star owns a career 3.38 ERA with 671 strikeouts for Chicago. Gary Cotton is a reporter for MLB.com. This story was not subject to the approval of Major League Baseball or its clubs.",
