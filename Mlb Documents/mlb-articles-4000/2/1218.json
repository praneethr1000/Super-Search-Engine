    "body": "Stan Musial and Earl Weaver couldn't have been much different in some ways, or much more alike in others. What these two sides of baseball's coin of competitive passion definitely had in common is that they were true icons, not only for their franchises but for the game itself.  The two Hall of Famers were unique fixtures in the game, and their passing on the same day Saturday dealt a double-dose of sadness to the sports world, perhaps not as much for lives cut short as out of reverence for lives devoted to baseball at the very highest level.  Saturday became the first day in history a pair of Hall of Famers passed away on the same day, with word in the morning of former Orioles manager Weaver's death at age 82 followed in the evening with the announcement that Cardinals legend Musial had passed away at age 92. Previously, the shortest time span between the deaths of Hall of Famers was three days in 1971, when Heinie Manush's passing on May 12 was followed by Goose Goslin's death on May 15. The news Saturday made for a uniquely reflective January day for any baseball fan who understands the impact each of these men had on the game in very different ways -- different from each other, and different from anyone else. That they happened to pass away on the same day shouldn't rob one iota of respect and appreciation from either. Certainly, their legacies each are large enough to deserve appropriate commemoration.              John Schlegel is a national reporter for MLB.com. Dan Cichalski contributed to this article.
