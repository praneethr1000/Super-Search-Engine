    "body": "The Blue Jays added a familiar face back to the organization on Friday, claiming right-hander Chad Beck off waivers from the Pirates.  Beck wasn't even gone from the Toronto organization long enough to be missed. The Pirates claimed Beck off waivers from the Blue Jays on Oct. 25.  In 2012, Beck pitched in 14 games for the Jays, all out of the bullpen, and posted a 6.32 ERA. The Blue Jays originally acquired Beck from the D-backs in exchange for David Eckstein on Aug. 31, 2008.   A 27-year-old righty from Jasper, Texas, Beck was designated for assignment by the Pirates on Dec. 26.  Ian Browne is a reporter for MLB.com.
