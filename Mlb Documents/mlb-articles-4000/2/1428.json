    "body": "Marlins slugger Giancarlo Stanton will add his powerful bat to the middle of Team USA's lineup in the World Baseball Classic.  The All-Star outfielder has committed to play for the United States in this year's Classic, according to a report by CBSSports.com's Jon Heyman, providing Team USA manager Joe Torre with another potent bat as the American club seeks its first WBC championship.  Fellow Major Leaguers Adam Jones, Brandon Phillips, Joe Mauer, David Wright and Ryan Braun have already expressed their intentions to play in the tournament. The World Baseball Classic rosters will be unveiled Thursday night on MLB Network. Asked in September if he would consider playing in the Classic, Stanton responded: \"Absolutely. Anything that represents your country is a big deal. It's relatively new. To have that be more popular, or make that more important to people, is ideal.   \"You never know how long a career can be, and you want to get that experience,\" he added. \"You never know how your health will be. In three years, something could go wrong. I'm able to do it now, and have no reason not to.\"   Stanton, the subject of many trade rumors since voicing his unhappiness over the Marlins' blockbuster trade with the Blue Jays, posted a .290\/.361\/.608 batting line and hit 37 home runs for Miami last season. In just three years with the Marlins, the 23-year-old has hit 93 homers. Adam Berry is a reporter for MLB.com. Follow him on Twitter at @adamdberry.
