    "body": "LOS ANGELES -- Dodgers outfielder Matt Kemp will serve as celebrity grand marshal for the 28th annual Kingdom Day Parade in recognition of Martin Luther King Day. The parade will be held Saturday in South Los Angeles.  Kemp, currently rehabilitating from October shoulder surgery, will be joined by Dodgers alumni Bobby Castillo, Tommy Davis, Al \"The Bull\" Ferrara, \"Sweet\" Lou Johnson, Lee Lacy, Kenny Landreaux, Tim Leary, Wes Parker, Dennis Powell, Derrel Thomas and Maury Wills, who will be riding in the Dodgers firetruck.  The Dodgers are a sponsor of the parade, whose theme will be \"His Dream Will Never Die.\" The parade starts at 10:30 a.m. PT from the intersection of Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard and Western Avenue and will be televised live locally on KABC-TV Channel 7. Kemp's involvement in the Los Angeles community dates back to 2007 and includes a Dodgers Dreamfield dedication in Compton, Christmas visits to Sweet Alice in Watts and the City of Hope Hospital in Duarte, and the establishment of Kemp's Kids in 2008, hosting children at Dodger Stadium.   He has raised more than $400,000 for families affected by autism at his annual Spring Training fundraiser and participated for several years in the Dodgers' annual Community Caravan and Dodgers Dream Foundation Bowling Extravaganza.   With teammate Clayton Kershaw, Kemp was honored by the Negro Leagues Museum last January with a Legacy Award.  Ken Gurnick is a reporter for MLB.com.
