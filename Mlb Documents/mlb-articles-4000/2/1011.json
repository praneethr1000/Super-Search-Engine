    "body": "The highlight of the Owners Meetings in Paradise Valley, Ariz., three weeks ago was Commissioner Bud Selig's announcement that, in conjunction with the Major League Baseball Players Association, greatly expanded drug testing would be put in place for the 2013 season. Selig fully understands how significant the changes -- establishing baseline testosterone levels for all players to make the use of synthetic testosterone easier to detect as well as year-round testing -- are. That point was emphasized Thursday with an endorsement from director general David Howman of the World Anti-Doping Agency. \"WADA welcomes the decision of Major League Baseball (MLB) and its players union to expand their drug-testing program for the 2013 season,\" Howman said. \"By agreeing to in-season testing for human growth hormone (hGH) and introducing longitudinal profiling for testosterone, MLB has significantly increased the effectiveness of its anti-doping program and enhanced its value in terms of deterrence. \"An anti-doping program can only be considered effective when it is allowed to monitor players the whole year round, and by making these changes the MLB has set a new standard for the other Pro Leagues to follow.\" Paul Hagen is a reporter for MLB.com This story was not subject to the approval of Major League Baseball or its clubs.",
