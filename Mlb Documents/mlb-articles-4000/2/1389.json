    "body": "SAN FRANCISCO -- Catcher Buster Posey, the reigning National League Most Valuable Player, heads the list of six Giants who filed for salary arbitration on Tuesday. Under the arbitration process, each player to file is considered signed. But there's no agreement on a salary until a compromise is reached, before or after the player and his club exchange suggested figures for a one-year deal. Or, if there's no compromise, the case goes before an arbitration panel, which rules for one side. Posey figures to receive an astronomical raise from the $615,000 he earned last season, when he led the NL in hitting, paced the league in All-Star voting and received numerous other awards and accolades.
