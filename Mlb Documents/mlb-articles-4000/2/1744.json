    "body": "CHICAGO -- Brent Morel told MLB.com at the end of November that his bothersome back, which hampered him all of the 2012 season, felt as good as it had in more than one year -- thanks to his work at Sparta Performance\/Science in California. After manager Robin Ventura saw Morel hit recently, he was in agreement that the team's starting third baseman at the start of 2012 had made great strides. \"He looks different,\" said Ventura of Morel. \"He looks great.\" Morel still has to prove his back can handle the wear and tear of everyday play and more than likely will start the 2013 season with Triple-A Charlotte.",
