    "body": "The Phillies took care of their only arbitration-eligible player Friday afternoon, signing left-hander Antonio Bastardo to a one-year, $1.4 million contract that includes award bonuses.  Friday was the deadline for players and teams to exchange salary figures. Bastardo, 27, was eligible for arbitration for the first time in his career. The 27-year-old went 2-5 with a save, a 4.33 ERA and 81 strikeouts in 52 innings last season.  He figures to be the Phillies' primary lefty setup man in 2013 after ranking third among all Major League relievers last year with 14.02 strikeouts per nine innings, which ranked behind only Braves closer Craig Kimbrel (16.66) and Reds closer Aroldis Chapman (15.32). Bastardo held opposing hitters to a .207 average and was especially tough on lefty hitters, who batted .169 against him. Signed by the Phillies in 2005 as an amateur free agent out of the Dominican Republic, Bastardo is 12-9 with a 4.02 ERA and 196 strikeouts in 152 1\/3 innings over parts of the past four seasons. He posted a 2.64 ERA, 6-1 record and eight saves in 2011. Adam Berry is a reporter for MLB.com. Follow him on Twitter at @adamdberry.
