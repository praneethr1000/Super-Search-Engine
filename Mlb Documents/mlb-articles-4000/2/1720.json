    "body": "DENVER -- The Rockies don't use a quarterback, being that they play baseball, but they nonetheless bolstered the position in the 2010 MLB First-Year Player Draft. The Rockies selected Clemson's Kyle Parker in the first round and North Carolina State's Russell Wilson in the fourth. After a brief time in the Rockies' system and a return to college football at Wisconsin, Wilson panned out -- this football season for the Seattle Seahawks. Now Parker, having a more conventional winding road to the big time, hopes to eventually make the same impact in the Major Leagues as a corner outfielder with the Rockies. Parker, ranked as the Rockies' No. 7 prospect in 2012 by MLB.com, made forward strides last season at Class A Modesto, where he hit .308 with 23 home runs, 18 doubles, six triples and 73 RBIs in 102 games. Health was the biggest hiccup. He suffered a broken right hand when hit by a pitch in the season's second game and missed a little more than a month, and a strained ligament in his left thumb cost him the end of the season and the playoffs. But when healthy, Parker had a season he could enjoy, and it didn't bother him seeing Wilson take a quicker path to big-time success in another sport. Thomas Harding is a reporter for MLB.com.
