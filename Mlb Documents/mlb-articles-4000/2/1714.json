    "body": "The Tigers' present popularity and positivity was probably best illustrated by the healthy scalping market that took place outside TigerFest at Comerica Park over the weekend.

Thing is, there's not a whole heck of a lot to discuss -â€“ at least, not in the realm of roster debate that so often flows from the lips of fans this time of year.
