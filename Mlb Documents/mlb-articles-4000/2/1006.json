    "body": "Former Major Leaguer and D-backs TV analyst Mark Grace has been sentenced to four months in jail under a work-release program, according to The Associated Press.  Grace, 48, pleaded guilty Thursday to felony endangerment and misdemeanor driving under the influence of alcohol. He was arrested in August in Scottsdale, Ariz., about 15 months after he was arrested and charged with DUI in June 2011.  Grace, who played 16 years as a first baseman with the Cubs and D-backs, was removed from his analyst position with the D-backs after being arrested last August but was welcomed back to participate in their fantasy camp in January. In October, Grace pleaded not guilty to four felony counts of aggravated DUI. He was scheduled to go to trial March 19 and could have faced more than three years in prison.   A Maricopa County Superior Court spokesman told the AP that Grace's jail sentence will begin Feb. 10, and his sentence also includes two years of probation. Adam Berry is a reporter for MLB.com.
