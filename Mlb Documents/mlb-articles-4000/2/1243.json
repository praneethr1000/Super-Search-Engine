    "body": "The sarcastic references began a long time ago and probably will not stop any time soon: The Pirates have got to stop letting 19-inning games kill them.  You know the drill. In 2011, they lose in 19 in Atlanta. In 2012, they win in 19 in St. Louis. After those marathons, the Pirates proceed to go a collective 31-71 and hard-fall out of two pennant races.  It makes for an ironic punch line and a neat bow to tie atop two collapses -- but it misses the real point, certainly as far as the 2012 fade was concerned.
