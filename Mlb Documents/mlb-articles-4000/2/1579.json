    "body": "The mystery of Francisco Liriano's broken right arm received some unsubstantiated clarification recently with a newspaper in his native Dominican Republic reporting he suffered it in a bathroom fall.  According to elcaribe.com, the newspaper's website, Liriano fell days after the Dec. 21 agreement on his original two-year, $12.75 million contract with the Pirates, fracturing the humerus bone in the upper arm.  Citing a \"source close to the player,\" the report said Liriano's right arm is in a cast. The report included no other details as to where or how exactly the left-handed pitcher had fallen. The accident forced the sides to revisit terms of the original contract and reopen negotiations, which were finalized on Monday, according to FOXSports.com. The club had no comment, as Liriano still must pass a physical to formalize the agreement.   Speaking to MLB.com earlier this month at the MLB Owners Meetings in Paradise Valley, Ariz., Pirates club chairman Bob Nutting had said, \"Liriano remains a player we are interested in. But we'll have to make absolutely sure that there's a 100 percent chance of his recovery and ability to play.\"   The potential total value of the deal remained the same, but Liriano agreed to a lower 2013 salary and to assume a shared risk.
