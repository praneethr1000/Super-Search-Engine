    "body": "CINCINNATI -- One of the final milepost markers of the offseason is about to be crossed with the arrival of the 2013 Reds Caravan. When the troupe of club personnel arrives in your town, you know baseball season is right around the corner.  Actually, lots of milepost markers will be crossed when members of the Reds hit the region's highways from Jan. 24-27. The caravan will split into three legs to make 15 fan stops in four states while covering more than 2,800 miles.  All fan stops are free and open to the public. At most visits, fans will have opportunities to interact with current and former players, broadcasters and front office staff. Time is usually set aside for question-and-answer sessions, the chance to pose for pictures and sign autographs. The Southern tour will zip through West Virginia, Ohio and Kentucky and carry third baseman Todd Frazier, reliever Logan Ondrusek (Thursday and Friday only), top Minor League prospect Billy Hamilton, broadcasters Jim Kelch and Jeff Brantley, vice president of baseball operations Dick Williams and mascot Rosie Red.     Each stop will also feature a raffle of two tickets to the April 1 Opening Day game vs. the Angels at Great American Ball Park. Tickets to the season's second home game vs. the Angels on April 3, also known as \"Opening Night,\" will be on sale at selected fan stops.    Mark Sheldon is a reporter for MLB.com.
