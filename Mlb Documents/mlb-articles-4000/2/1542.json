    "body": "PHOENIX -- After the 2012 regular season had ended, outfielder Justin Upton's agent, Larry Reynolds, had a discussion with D-backs general manager Kevin Towers about potentially trading Upton.  Trade rumors involving Upton had swirled throughout the season, and it was the second time Upton had found himself at the center of trade talk, with the first coming just after Towers had taken over as GM in 2010.  While Reynolds made it clear he did not demand a trade, he did tell Towers that with the circumstances being what they were, it might be best for both parties if a trade was made. “We never demanded a trade, but there were discussions between Kevin Towers and myself about the possibility of trading Justin between the end of the season and the trade,” Reynolds said. “I have a good relationship with K.T., so those discussions were amicable.”   The rumors finally became reality Thursday when the D-backs dealt Upton and Chris Johnson to the Braves for five players.
