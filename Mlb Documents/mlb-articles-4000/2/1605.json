    "body": "During the Giants' World Series victory parade last Halloween through the streets of San Francisco, third baseman Pablo Sandoval told the crowd in Spanish: \"This is the second, but there are going to be a lot more. You should enjoy this and feel this in your hearts.\" It is almost time for the Giants to begin preparing in Arizona for what they hope will be their third championship season in four years, but first their fans have another way to enjoy this one. Bidding is under way at the Giants Postseason and World Series Auction, and all 102 used and authenticated listings are scheduled to close at 8 p.m. ET on Jan. 30. For starters, you can bid on the signed \"PABLO SANDOVAL\" magnet that was affixed to Panda's convertible during that same parade. There are 31 such car magnets, including that one in case you didn't recognize the World Series Most Valuable Player, or National League MVP Award winner Buster Posey or Hall of Famers Juan Marichal and Gaylord Perry. Other items include: Pitching rubber. This was installed on the AT&T Park mound as a replacement after the homestand in which Matt Cain threw his June 13 perfect game, so it was used from June 25 through Game 2 of the World Series. That means the successful bidder will own the same rubber that Sergio Romo pushed off of to throw a 79-mph, 2-2 slider to Omar Infante for a popup that would end the last home game played by the 2012 World Series champions.  World Series Game 1 Orange K Board. In case you missed out on last summer's hot bidding for those Perfect Cain K boards, you have another chance here with nine of these signs hung at AT&T Park during various postseason games. That includes the Fall Classic opener, when Barry Zito struck out three and Tim Lincecum came in to strike out five more.  Dave Righetti's No. 33 road jersey. The team's pitching coach wore this gray jersey for the three NL Division Series games at Cincinnati, the three NL Championship Series games at St. Louis, and for Game 3 of the World Series at Detroit. As of Tuesday, the high bid was $300.  Postseason Street Banner. The one featuring outfielders Angel Pagan, Gregor Blanco and Hunter Pence doing a triple chest bump is among 10 such banners that hung along the streets last October.  NLDS Game 1 Lineup Card. Remember how it all began? With pageantry, hope and a 5-2 loss to the Reds. But it was the start of what would be two classic comeback series for the Giants, and this Game 1 card is signed by manager Bruce Bochy. There are nine postseason lineup cards.  Everything but the bubbly. There are 40 empty champagne bottles or corks up for bidding, saved from all three clinch celebrations, their contents emptied upon Giants personnel in the clubhouses.
