    "body": "OAKLAND -- The A's came to terms with their final arbitration-eligible players on Friday, agreeing to one-year deals with Brandon Moss and Jerry Blevins.  Contract figures were not released, per team policy.  Blevins was projected to earn $1 million in 2013 after posting a career-best 2.48 ERA and .201 opponents' average in 63 relief appearances for Oakland in 2012 -- his second full season with the club and seventh overall. Moss, too, enjoyed a breakout campaign, hitting .291 with 21 home runs and 52 RBIs in just 84 games. To put those numbers in perspective, the 29-year-old had just 15 home runs and 78 RBIs in 249 games entering the 2012 season.   Expected to again share first-base duties with Chris Carter, Moss is anticipated to earn around $1.4 million this year.   In total, the A's payroll should be around $60 million this season.
