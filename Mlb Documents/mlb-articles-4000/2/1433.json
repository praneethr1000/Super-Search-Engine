    "body": "MIAMI -- Some experienced depth appears to be returning to the Marlins.  Austin Kearns will sign a Minor League contract with the Marlins with an invitation to Spring Training, according to the Miami Herald.  Kearns, 32, made the 2012 Marlins as a non-roster invitee, and he was used primarily as a right-handed bat off the bench. In 87 games, the veteran outfielder batted .245 with four home runs and 16 RBIs. Kearns provides depth as a corner outfielder and at first base.   The Marlins have a concern at first base, because Logan Morrison's status is unclear. Morrison is recovering from right knee surgery, and he isn't expected to begin running until about a week into Spring Training.   If Morrison isn't ready, the team will be looking at other first-base options.   The Marlins are not interested in bringing back free-agent first baseman Carlos Lee.
