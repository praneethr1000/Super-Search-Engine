    "body": "MILWAUKEE -- The Brewers added to their Minor League outfield depth Friday by finalizing a deal with Cole Garner, a 28-year-old who played in four games with the Rockies in 2011.  Garner, a right-handed hitter and thrower who has mostly manned the outfield corners, batted .258 with six home runs and 25 RBIs in 64 games last season with the Yankees' Triple-A Scranton\/Wilkes-Barre club. He is a .283 hitter in eight Minor League seasons, with 82 home runs and 371 RBIs.  The Brewers invited Garner to their early Minor League mini-camp but not to big league Spring Training.
