    "body": "ST. LOUIS -- Having sealed the necessary financing for the project, the Cardinals and real estate development company Cordish Companies began preliminary construction work on what is to be the future site of Ballpark Village. The Cardinals announced that a formal groundbreaking ceremony at the site will be held on Feb. 8 at 11 a.m. CT. That groundbreaking ceremony had been expected to take place in mid-November, but had to be pushed back while the financing was finalized. Despite the delay, the Cardinals said in a news release that they still anticipate the first phase of Ballpark Village being completed by Opening Day 2014. The first phase, which will cost approximately $100 million, will cover construction of retail and entertainment space along Clark Street, which runs adjacent to Busch Stadium, as well as the infrastructure necessary to handle future development on the site. Highlights of this first phase will include the Cardinals Nation venue, Budweiser Brew House and  Live at Ballpark Village!Â Cardinals Nation will hold the Cardinals' Hall of Fame and Museum, as well as a two-story restaurant. Both Cardinals Nation and the Budweiser Brew House will boast rooftop decks with views into the ballpark.  Live at Ballpark Village!  will serve as an event space with a retractable canopy.
