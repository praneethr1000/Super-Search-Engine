    "title": "Upton deal would be a head-scratcher",
    "subtitle": "Rare is it that a team pursues trading a young, talented player with multiyear contract",
    "body": "At some point soon, perhaps before Spring Training starts, Justin Upton may don the jersey of a Major League team other than the Arizona Diamondbacks for the first time. If so, that club will have acquired one of baseball's most valuable commodities: a young veteran with a reasonable contract who has already displayed virtually every skill that an outfielder can possess.  Upton has hit for average and power. He's shown speed and the ability to get on base. He's played quality defense and has an impressive throwing arm. He's under contract for the next three years for a total of $38.5 million. Even coming off a down year, Upton is one of the most valuable commodities in the game.  Conventional baseball wisdom says that it's just about impossible for a club to win a deal in which it sends away a player who fits that description. And yet, indications are that the D-backs aren't just listening to offers for the 25-year-old slugger, they're actively shopping him. Matthew Leach is a writer for MLB.com.
