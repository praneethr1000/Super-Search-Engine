    "body": "It appears that Justin Upton would prefer to spend his summers in Phoenix rather than Seattle.  It's Upton's life. It's Upton's career. It's Upton's choice. But those of us who have been in both Phoenix and Seattle in the summer are allowed a raised eyebrow. Or two.

The Mariners have been seeking an impact bat, and they have some prime pitching prospects who make them attractive trading partners. Mike Bauman is a national columnist for MLB.com.
