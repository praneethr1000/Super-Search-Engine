    "body": "DENVER -- The Rockies plan to return to the fence-busting, Coors Field-dominating ways of old, but Jordan Pacheco stands as a reminder that there is value in being portable. Last year, Pacheco led the injury-affected Rockies -- and topped National League rookies -- with a .309 batting average. On the road, Pacheco's .274 average in 237 at-bats was best among Rockies with at least 200 road at-bats. Dexter Fowler's .262 was next highest. Pacheco's .300 road on-base percentage also put him on decent ground in a stat category that traditionally has been a dicey one for Rockies young and old. After last year's 68-94 finish, the club's emphasis under new manager Walt Weiss and new hitting coach Dante Bichette will be on restoring the intimidating offense in an intimidating home park. But the Rockies will need smart, team-oriented hitters who can move runners and manufacture runs on the road, especially in an NL West where parks predominantly favor pitchers.
