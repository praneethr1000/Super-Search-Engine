    "body": "MIAMI -- The Phillies outfield is full of new faces. Shane Victorino and Hunter Pence are gone, while Delmon Young and Ben Revere have arrived to join Domonic Brown, Darin Ruf, Laynce Nix and John Mayberry. \"I think we've got a great group of guys,\" Mayberry said. \"We're a bunch of guys that can go in there every night and give you good at-bats. I think we definitely improved the strength of our team by getting those guys.\" Mayberry, who can play all three outfield positions, hit .245 with 14 homers and 46 RBIs in 149 games last season. This year, the 29-year-old hopes to improve on those numbers and be more consistent. \"I want to contribute in any way that I can,\" Mayberry said. \"I want to make sure my approach is sound and that I put together good at-bats. Hopefully [manager] Charlie [Manuel] will have the confidence in me to give those at-bats.\" Mayberry was in Miami on Saturday to attend Cardinals outfielder Jon Jay's Celebrity Bowling Challenge. The event raised more than $30,000 for the Boys & Girls Club of Miami-Dade. \"Jon Jay is just a great guy,\" Mayberry said. \"I've had the opportunity to know him for several years and he carries himself with the utmost class. When he has the opportunity to give back, he does it and I am happy to support him.\" With Spring Training just a few weeks away, Mayberry is anxious to get back to baseball after an offseason filled with workouts and preparation. \"I'm always excited this time of year,\" Mayberry said. \"It's good to take a little time off, but at some point, it starts to get boring and you want to get back out there playing.\" Beyond getting back to baseball, Mayberry is excited to see how new teammates like Michael Young and Revere help get the Phillies back on track after a disappointing 2012 season. \"I think at the beginning of every season there is a certain amount of positive energy that helps bring a team together,\" Mayberry said. \"Sometimes being in new surroundings can be a spark for a player or a team. I'm looking forward to working with those guys and winning some ballgames.\" David Villavicencio is a contributor to MLB.com.
