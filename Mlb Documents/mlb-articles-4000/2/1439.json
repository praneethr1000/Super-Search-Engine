    "body": "MESQUITE, Texas -- General manager Jon Daniels said this week that the Rangers are \"real comfortable\" with their outfield as they head toward Spring Training. He also suggested the club still may look at ways to reinforce that area.  Industry sources say the Rangers are still engaged in trade discussions and haven't ruled out the possibility of pulling off something major before the offseason is over. They have had discussions all winter with the D-backs concerning Justin Upton and Jason Kubel, and the Nationals are trying to move Mike Morse.  But right now, with fewer than five weeks to go before Spring Training, David Murphy is in an unusual situation of having an everyday job. What the Rangers may or may not do between now and their arrival in Arizona may change that, but at this moment, Murphy is their regular left fielder. T.R. Sullivan is a reporter for MLB.com.
