    "body": "Each Friday leading up to Spring Training, MLB.com will be taking a look at a different position as part of the Pirates' 2013 season preview. First up was catchers. This week, corner infielders are featured.  In baseball's ideal scheme, the corners of the infield are power positions, and the Pirates are in good position to utilize that blueprint. In 2012, third baseman Pedro Alvarez and first baseman Garrett Jones -- who also spent a lot of time in the outfield -- combined for 57 homers, and in the National League, only the Washington tandem of Ryan Zimmerman and Adam LaRoche had more, 58.  Barring any cast changes, then, the Bucs are set at the corners. Alvarez, turning 26 early next month, has the hot corner franchise. Two veterans, Gaby Sanchez being the other, and high-upside prospects Clint Robinson and Jerry Sands make first base one of the deepest positions.
