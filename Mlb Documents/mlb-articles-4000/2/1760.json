    "body": "WASHINGTON -- The Nationals are planning to raise ticket prices in 2013 after a successful '12 campaign and an upcoming season with a lot of expectations. But the team is also giving loyal fans a chance to avoid the increase. Anyone who purchases one- or two-year deals on full, half and partial season-ticket plans, as well as one-year deals on mini plans, will receive a discount if they purchase before April 1. \"Typically you see teams increase pricing right after a playoff run, but we made a conscious decision to give our fans the opportunity, prior to raising ticket prices in 2013, to lock in 2012 pricing,\" said chief operating officer Andy Feffer. \"Not only can you get in for this year, but you can lock in 2012 pricing for the next two years, which is a pretty substantial savings when you look at it over a two-year period.\" Watching a baseball game isn't the only thing to do at Nationals Park. The Nats have been actively upgrading the fan experience each year to provide incremental value for their customers. Washington launched the first online fan loyalty program in MLB. \"By being a season-ticket holder, and only by being a season-ticket holder, you become part of our loyalty program called Red Carpet Rewards,\" Feffer said. \"We give you points based on your investment to use on things of substantial, real value that are distinctive and different.\" The Nationals Red Carpet Rewards online loyalty program allows season-plan holders to redeem points for ticket upgrades, parking and experiences such as batting practice, autograph sessions, pregame activities and other events. New for the 2013 season, RCR members will have the opportunity to participate in exclusive auctions that will include autographed merchandise, premium tickets and more. Members will also enjoy exclusive discounts at various concession stands throughout the season. Fans interested in purchasing 2013 plans may do so by visiting nationals.com\/2013 (season plans) and nationals.com\/miniplans (mini plans) or calling 202-675-NATS (6287), option No. 1.
