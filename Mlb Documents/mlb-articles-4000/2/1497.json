    "body": "SEATTLE -- General manager Jack Zduriencik didn’t want to get into a public discussion of the Mariners’ attempt to extend Felix Hernandez’s contract this offseason, but he again made it clear the club wants to keep the 26-year-old ace in a Seattle uniform for as long as possible.  Ken Rosenthal of FOXSports.com reported Tuesday that the Mariners have at least been weighing a four-year, $100 million extension offer. With Hernandez already owed $40.5 million over the next two seasons, that would bring his current deal to essentially six years at $140 million.  Zduriencik, as per his normal policy, wasn’t discussing any of that at Wednesday’s pre-Spring Training media luncheon. “I don’t want to comment on that right now,” he said. “I’ll just say this. I’ve made it clear, any time anyone’s asked me, I have every intention of keeping Felix here for the long term.”",
