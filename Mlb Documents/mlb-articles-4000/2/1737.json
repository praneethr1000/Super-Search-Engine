    "body": "The Rockies and Jhoulys Chacin avoided arbitration with a two-year, $6.5 million deal that the right-hander announced Saturday and the club announced on Tuesday.  Chacin, who turned 25 this month, went 3-5 with a 4.43 ERA in 69 innings and 14 starts last season. He filed for a $2.6 million salary in 2013, while the team offered $1.7 million, had the case gone to arbitration. This was Chacin's first year of arbitration eligibility. He missed a large chunk of 2012 because of a nerve issue on the right side of his chest. After he returned to action in the second half he pitched much better. He posted a 2.84 ERA after the All-Star break, compared to a 7.30 mark before. Evan Drellich is a reporter for MLB.com. Follow him on Twitter @EvanDrellich.
