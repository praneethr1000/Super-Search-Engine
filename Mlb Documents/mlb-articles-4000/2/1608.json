    "subtitle": "Brewers outfielder's MRI sent for further evaluation before undergoing procedure",
    "body": "Brewers first baseman Corey Hart, who last week developed swelling in his knee during offseason workouts, did not undergo surgery as expected Tuesday and will instead seek a second opinion.  The MRI of Hart's right knee has been sent to Vail, Colo., for examination by Dr. Richard Steadman, Brewers assistant general manager Gord Ash said Tuesday.  Hart originally was scheduled to undergo arthroscopic surgery on his right knee for a debridement of his knee joint and to repair a meniscal tear by Dr. William Raasch on Tuesday in Milwaukee -- with a recovery time expected to be three to four months -- but he opted to seek a second opinion, which is a player's right, Ash said. \"Dr. Steadman is going to, at some point, read that MRI and determine if we should go with the original course of action, or if he's going to need to see Corey for a further evaluation,\" Ash said.   Ash said the Brewers and Hart are hopeful for a resolution within the next day or two.   Hart, 30, hit .270 with 30 homers and 83 RBIs in 149 games last season. Cash Kruth is a reporter for MLB.com.
