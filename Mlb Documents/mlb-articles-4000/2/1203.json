    "subtitle": "",
    "body": "With the passing of Earl Weaver on Saturday at age 82, baseball lost another of the greatest managers ever to set foot on the dugout steps, his death following those of Sparky Anderson and Dick Williams in recent years.  Those members of the Hall of Fame left quite a legacy, each in his own way, but there remain many managerial greats among us -- a cadre of special former skippers, some actively involved in baseball, others enjoying retirement.  Two of them are in the Hall of Fame as managers, and still others as players. A few are on the cusp of being considered for that highest honor very soon as among those eligible on the 2014 ballot. And that's just part of the club. John Schlegel is a national reporter for MLB.com. This story was not subject to the approval of Major League Baseball or its clubs.",
