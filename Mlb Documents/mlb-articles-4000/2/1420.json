    "body": "ANAHEIM -- The Angels have hired former pitcher Mark Langston to be their new radio analyst, joining play-by-play man Terry Smith and replacing Jose Mota. Mota will become an analyst for the Angels' ever-expanding Spanish-language television coverage on FOX Sports West, while continuing to work the English-language pregame and postgame show. Spanish-language broadcasts of Angels games are expected to increase from 50 to about 75 games next season and could reach 150 in a few years. Langston, who has been filling in for Mota on the radio the last few years, spent eight of his 16 years in the Majors pitching in an Angels uniform, making three All-Star teams, compiling a 3.97 ERA and throwing the first seven innings of a combined no-hitter with Mike Witt in 1990.",
