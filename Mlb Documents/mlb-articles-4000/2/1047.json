    "body": "NEW YORK -- On Monday, the Mets remained the only team in the Majors that had not signed a big league free agent. That will eventually change, general manager Sandy Alderson said in a telephone interview Monday evening, though the Mets are not close on any deals for pitchers.  And the roster will not necessarily change in a big way. Nothing will. Though the Mets hope to add a starting pitcher and at least one veteran reliever before Opening Day, they may be done adding hitters.  \"The free-agent market for outfielders has shrunk,\" Alderson said, noting that he does not plan to acquire any additional Major League infielders or catchers. \"We've watched that happen. We think that the free-agent market for outfielders was almost as overpriced as the market for starting pitching. But be that as it may, we're still looking. Anthony DiComo is a reporter for MLB.com.
