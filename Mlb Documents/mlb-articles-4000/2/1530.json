Morgan, who often refers to himself as Plush and uses the Twitter account @TheRealTPlush, batted .239 in 122 games for Milwaukee last season. He hit .304 for the club in 2011. The 32-year-old has spent six Major League seasons with the Pirates, Nationals and Brewers, amassing 117 stolen bases and a career average of .280. Zack Meisel is a reporter for MLB.com.
