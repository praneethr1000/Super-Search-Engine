    "body": "Javier Vazquez appears set to become the latest ballplayer to cover The Jackson 5's \"Never Can Say Goodbye.\" Intensely scouted in the Puerto Rico Winter League playoffs, during which he had a 1.23 ERA in four starts, Vazquez is weighing offers to come back to the game from which he walked away 16 months ago.  Interested teams are serenading him with the siren song, and the 36-year-old right-hander will probably hum along. As many before Vazquez have found out, and many others after him will come to the same realization, leaving is easy but staying away is hard. It sometimes seems like everyone but Shane comes back.  Hardest of all is coming back and making an impact, bringing game, not just name. Andy Pettitte just did it, contributing to another Yankees division title after a year in ... retirement? Let's just call it a sabbatical. Tom Singer is a reporter for MLB.com and writes an MLBlog Change for a Nickel. He can also be found on Twitter @Tom_Singer.
