    "body": "DENVER -- The Rockies have avoided arbitration with right-handed setup man Wilton Lopez and left-handed pitcher Josh Outman by signing each to a one-year contract, the club announced Wednesday. According to a Major League source, Lopez, who came from the Astros in a trade for right-handed pitcher Alex White, signed for $1.7625 million, and Outman, a starter and reliever last season who bounced between the Rockies and the Minors, signed for $675,000. Lopez is expected to join righty Matt Belisle and lefty Rex Brothers as the setup troika for closer Rafael Betancourt. Outman, who finished strong in the Majors and pitched well as a starter in the Dominican Republic this winter, will compete to be a starter but also could pitch in the Rockies' hybrid role -- one of three pitchers who will pitch on a rotation and could be used to face one batter, for one inning, or for multiple innings.
