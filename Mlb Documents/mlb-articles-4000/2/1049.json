    "body": "ARLINGTON -- Lance Berkman officially joined the Rangers on Monday night. He is coming to Arlington to be primarily the Rangers designated hitter in a lineup that is expected to have Ian Kinsler at second base and Mitch Moreland at first base.  Berkman has played both outfield and first base in his career, but he underwent two surgeries on his right knee last season and will likely be limited to how much he can play in the field.  \"I primarily see myself as the DH, particularly in the first part of the season,\" Berkman said. \"If I progress and stay healthy, I'm not ruling out playing first base and playing some outfield. It's a matter of what [they] want to do, but I'm going to make myself physically able to play the field.\" T.R. Sullivan is a reporter for MLB.com.
