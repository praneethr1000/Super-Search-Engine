    "subtitle": "",
    "body": "The Orioles have avoided arbitration with Nolan Reimold, agreeing Friday to a one-year deal with the outfielder. Reimold, 29, played in just 16 games last year after a herniated disk in his neck landed him on the disabled list from May 1 through the end of the season. In his lone month of action, however, he hit .313 (21-for-67) and still managed five home runs and 10 RBIs. The left fielder also played well in limited action in 2011, connecting for 13 home runs, 10 doubles and three triples while driving in 45 runs over 87 games. In his four Major League seasons, all with the Orioles, Reimold is a .261 hitter with 36 long balls and 114 RBIs. With Reimold under contract, the Orioles now have only eight arbitration-eligible players -- Matt Wieters, Chris Davis, Brian Matusz, Troy Patton, Tommy Hunter, Jason Hammel, Jim Johnson and Darren O'Day.
