    "body": "SAN FRANCISCO -- Right-hander Mason Tobin joined the competition for what's expected to be one, and only one, vacancy in the Giants' bullpen, signing a Minor League contract with an invitation to big league Spring Training. Tobin has not pitched since April 2011 with the Texas Rangers. Receiving his first Major League action, he recorded a 6.75 ERA in four appearances before injuring his throwing elbow. Tobin then underwent Tommy John surgery for the second time. Tobin's agent, Steve Canter, said Friday that the 25-year-old impressed Giants scouts during a workout earlier this month in Scottsdale, Ariz. Chris Haft is a reporter for MLB.com.
