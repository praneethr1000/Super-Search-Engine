    "body": "NEW YORK -- Days after allegations surfaced that Alex Rodriguez allegedly made purchases of performance-enhancing drugs from a South Florida clinic over the past four years, another report has emerged with sources claiming that the Yankees slugger was injected by Anthony Bosch, a nutritionist who was connected to Manny Ramirez's 2009 suspension for violating Major League Baseball's drug policy. According to an ESPN.com report, Bosch made visits to Rodriguez's Florida home on Biscayne Bay, typically late at night, to administer the drugs. Other athletes, the report stated, relied on middle men to deliver the PED's Bosch supplied. \"Only Tony handled A-Rod,\" one source told ESPN's \"Outside the Lines.\" The report cited several sources as saying that Bosch was open about his relationship with Rodriguez, and that Bosch said the third baseman once angrily kicked Bosch out of his home last spring when Bosch had trouble locating a vein during an injection. \"Tony said A-Rod was [angry] at him,\" a source told ESPN.com. \"[Bosch] said [A-Rod] was bleeding everywhere.\" According to the report, a spokesperson for Rodriguez said Friday that \"the allegations are not true.\" The Miami New Times reported Tuesday that it had obtained records that indicated Rodriguez had an ongoing relationship with Bosch.  A spokesman for Rodriguez issued the following statement in response to that published article: \"The news report about a purported relationship between Alex Rodriguez and Anthony Bosch are not true. Alex Rodriguez was not Mr. Bosch's patient, he was never treated by him and he was never advised by him. The purported documents referenced in the story ‐‐ at least as they relate to Alex Rodriguez ‐‐ are not legitimate.\"  Rodriguez's full name or nicknames reportedly appeared on 16 occasions in the documents obtained by the Miami New Times from a former employee of Biogenesis, Bosch's now-shuttered anti-aging clinic. Major League Baseball responded to the Miami New Times report by releasing a statement that said the league is \"always extremely disappointed to learn of potential links between players and the use of performance-enhancing substances,\" noting that MLB's Department of Investigations has \"been actively involved in the issues in South Florida.\" A statement by the Yankees added: \"We fully support the Commissioner's Joint Drug Prevention and Treatment Program. This matter is now in the hands of the Commissioner's Office. We will have no further comment until that investigation has concluded.\" Rodriguez's Yankees contract has five years and $114 million remaining, and the team will monitor MLB's investigation closely to weigh any potential effect of the new allegations. No contract has ever been voided in a similar scenario; the Yankees looked into nixing Jason Giambi's contract in 2004 but were unable to do so. Rodriguez has previously confessed to using performance-enhancing drugs, with the Rangers from 2001-03, but he made that admission after signing the 10-year, $275 million deal prior to the 2009 season. Rodriguez has repeatedly said that he has not used PEDs at any time during his career with the Yankees. A source confirmed that Rodriguez, who is expected to miss at least the first half of the regular season while recovering from left hip surgery, could face a suspension even without a positive test. The source stressed, however, that this can apply to any player linked to PEDs. For example, outfielders Jay Gibbons and Jose Guillen were suspended in 2007 for \"non-analytical positives\" when it was learned that they purchased human growth hormone and steroids. Astros outfielder Jordan Schafer, then a Minor Leaguer, was similarly disciplined the following year. The New Times report also implicates outfielder Melky Cabrera, pitcher Bartolo Colon and catcher Yasmani Grandal, all of whom were suspended for PED use last season, as well as Nationals left-hander Gio Gonzalez and Rangers outfielder Nelson Cruz. Rodriguez is not known to have failed any PED tests administered by MLB, but investigators have approached him about possible links to drug use in 2009, when Rodriguez admitted to his past experiences following a Sports Illustrated article, and again in '10 when Rodriguez was linked to Canadian doctor Anthony Galea, who had been indicted on charges that he distributed HGH to professional athletes. \"We remain fully committed to following all leads and seeking the appropriate outcomes for all those who use, purchase and are involved in the distribution of banned substances, which have no place in our game,\" MLB's statement said. \"We are in the midst of an active investigation and are gathering and reviewing information. We will refrain from further comment until this process is complete.\" Handwritten records obtained by the newspaper identify Rodriguez as \"Alex Rodriguez,\" \"Alex Rod\" and his nickname at the clinic, \"Cacique,\" the name of a pre-Colombian Caribbean chief. In a 2009 notebook, Rodriguez is marked as having paid $3,500 for a product identified as \"1.5\/1.5 HGH (sports perf.) creams test., glut., MIC, supplement, sports perf. Diet.\" Human growth hormone is banned by Major League Baseball, as are testosterone creams. Another record links \"Cacique\" to a regimen that includes IGF-1, a banned substance in baseball that stimulates insulin production and muscle growth. Additionally, Rodriguez was listed as buying \"troches\" and \"pink cream,\" which Bosch's notes indicate included testosterone, as well as \"GHRP,\" a substance that releases growth hormones. A 2009 client list also features Rodriguez's cousin, Yuri Sucart, whom Rodriguez named as a supplier of drugs when he admitted to his past use. The Yankees banned Sucart from all team facilities after he popped up during a 2009 Spring Training game. The newspaper reports that Bosch's records continue through last season. A notebook labeled \"2012\" bears a heading of \"A-Rod\/Cacique\" and notes: \"He is paid through April 30th. He will owe May 1 $4,000... I need to see him between April 13-19, deliver troches, pink cream, and... May meds. Has three weeks of Sub-Q (as of April).\" Elsewhere in his notes, Bosch wrote that \"Sub-Q\" referred to a mixture including HGH and IGF-1. The Yankees were in New York from the period of April 13-19 of last season, opening their home schedule by playing a seven-game homestand against the Angels and Twins. Rodriguez is expected to be sidelined until at least July after undergoing arthroscopic left hip surgery earlier this month. The Yankees have said that they anticipate that Rodriguez will be able to return to the lineup after the All-Star break, but they have acknowledged the possibility that he could miss the entire season.
