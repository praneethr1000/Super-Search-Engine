    "subtitle": "",
    "body": "Though Bartolo Colon's winter ball stats equate to a small sample size, the A's are convinced that the veteran right-hander has maintained the form that helped him win 10 games for them last year.  Playing for Aguilas Cibaenas, four months after he was handed a 50-game suspension by Major League Baseball for testing positive for an excessive level of testosterone, Colon tallied 13 2\/3 innings over four starts. He held opponents scoreless in two starts, while surrendering a combined eight (seven earned) in the other two.  Like vintage Colon, he struck out 13 and allowed just one walk, and A's assistant general manager David Forst said Colon \"looked good in all four of his starts, based on reports.\" Jane Lee is a reporter for MLB.com.
