    "body": "The White Sox added a veteran reliever to their bullpen on Friday, signing right-hander Matt Lindstrom to a one-year contract with a club option for 2014. Lindstrom, 32, will make $2.3 million in 2013 with a $4 million club option for 2014. The deal has a $500,000 buyout clause. Last season, the righty went 1-0 with a 2.68 ERA and 40 strikeouts over 47 innings in his 46 combined games with the Orioles and D-backs. He made his first 34 appearances with the Orioles before being traded to Arizona in late August, as part of a deal that sent Joe Saunders to Baltimore. “Matt’s addition helps solidify our bullpen with a power arm and a veteran presence,” said Rick Hahn, White Sox senior vice president and general manager. “He has excelled in many different bullpen roles during his career, and we are excited to add him to our strong group of relievers.” Lindstrom has also pitched for the Marlins (2007-09), Astros (2010) and Rockies (2011) during his six-year Major League career. Overall, he has a 13-15 record to go along with a 3.64 ERA and 45 career saves.  Paul Casella is a reporter for MLB.com. Follow him on Twitter @paul_casella.
