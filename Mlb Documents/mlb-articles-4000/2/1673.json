    "body": "ST. LOUIS -- The Cardinals announced on Tuesday that they have reached a multiyear agreement with Mercy Health of St. Louis that makes Mercy the official medical provider for the organization. As a part of this arrangement, Mercy will cover the Cardinals' orthopedic and sports-medicine needs.  Mercy, which is one of Missouri's largest employers, already provides the team physicians for the club's Double-A affiliate in Springfield.  The Cardinals will retain several members of their previous medical staff, including team physician Dr. George Paletta, who has worked with the Cardinals for the last 15 years. Lyndon Gross will return for his seventh season as the team's orthopedic surgeon. During Tuesday's press conference, it was also announced that Mercy Clinic Sports Medicine specialist Dr. Brian Mahaffey and internist Dr. Jason Hand will serve on the Cardinals' care team.
