    "body": "SEATTLE -- Justin Smoak knows the story. He knows this will be a big Spring Training for him. He knows the Mariners acquired Kendrys Morales, Mike Morse and Raul Ibanez to compete at first base and designated hitter.  And, yeah, he knows it's time to show he's capable of living up to the expectations both of the team and himself after a tough 2012 that ended on an up note with a red-hot final three weeks.  \"I'm excited,\" Smoak said from his offseason home in Charleston, S.C. \"We've got some guys who can hit, and that's what you want. For me, personally, I know if I just play like I should play, I've got nothing to worry about. I know for a fact, this is the most confidence I've ever felt going into a season.\" Greg Johns is a reporter for MLB.com. Follow him on Twitter @GregJohnsMLB as well as his Mariners Musings blog.
