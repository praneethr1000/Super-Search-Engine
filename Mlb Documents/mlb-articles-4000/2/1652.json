    "body": "DENVER -- Although they didn't plan to sign any of their arbitration-eligible players for more than one year, the Rockies agreed to a two-year deal with right-handed pitcher Jhoulys Chacin and would be willing to consider a multiyear contract with outfielder Dexter Fowler. Sources with knowledge of the team's position said Monday that the Rockies are willing to go more than one year with Fowler, their only arbitration-eligible player who hasn't reached an agreement, if his representatives can come up with a proposal to the club's liking. Under the figures that were traded as part of the arbitration process, Fowler is seeking $5.15 million and the team is offering $4.25 million. Arbitration hearings are scheduled for Feb. 4-20.
