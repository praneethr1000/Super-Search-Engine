    "body": "WASHINGTON -- The Nationals will host the Yankees in an exhibition game at Nationals Park on March 29 at 2:05 p.m. ET.  Tickets to the game will be included in full, half and partial season-ticket plans. In addition, tickets to the exhibition will be included in select mini and flex plans to be released in the coming weeks before single-game tickets go on sale to the general public. Season-ticket plans may be purchased at nationals.com\/2013 or by calling 202-675-NATS (6287).  A portion of the proceeds from the Yanks-Nats game will benefit the Washington Nationals Dream Foundation, a charitable organization committed to improving the lives of children throughout the Washington Capital Region.
