    "body": "DENVER -- Rockies outfielder Dexter Fowler, coming off his best season, and right-hander Jhoulys Chacin, who is bouncing back from an injury-shortened 2012, were among six Rockies to file for arbitration, the MLB Players Association announced Tuesday. Also filing were outfielder Tyler Colvin, right-handed pitcher Wilton Lopez, shortstop Jonathan Herrera and left-handed pitcher Josh Outman. Player and club figures are to be exchanged Friday, and teams and players will attempt to negotiate a contract. If an agreement cannot be reached, arbitration hearings before a three-judge panel -- which will choose either the player's figure or the team's for his 2013 salary -- will be conducted Feb. 4-20. Teams can sign players to one-year or multiyear deals to avoid arbitration. A source said the team is not expected to grant any multiyear deals this year. Thomas Harding is a reporter for MLB.com.
