    "body": "NEW YORK -- Phil Hughes and the Yankees have agreed on a one-year, non-guaranteed contract, avoiding salary arbitration. Hughes, 26, was 16-13 with a 4.23 ERA in 32 starts with the Yanks last season and was arbitration-eligible for the third and final time. The deal is worth $7.15 million for Hughes, who is entering an important year as he could be a free agent after the season. Hughes earned $3.2 million last season. New York has three arbitration-eligible players remaining: pitchers Joba Chamberlain, Boone Logan and David Robertson. The Yankees have not been to arbitration since 2008, when they defeated pitcher Chien-Ming Wang in a hearing. Bryan Hoch is a reporter for MLB.com.
