    "body": "SAN FRANCISCO -- Jeremy Affeldt has donated time and effort for years toward ending human trafficking and slavery. Recently, Affeldt gave something else to the cause: his presence. As he took a weeklong sojourn to Asia, Affeldt felt an unmistakable deepening of his devotion toward helping innocent victims worldwide -- though it might not have been possible to fathom his commitment growing any stronger. Affeldt took his first overseas trip to observe what Not For Sale, the organization that's striving to help vulnerable people everywhere, has achieved and has left to accomplish. The left-handed Giants reliever accompanied Not For Sale founder David Batstone to South Korea and Thailand, departing Dec. 27 and returning last Thursday. Instead of celebrating New Year's Eve with his wife, Larissa, and three sons, Affeldt happened to land in Bangkok close to midnight local time on Dec. 31 and watched airport employees suddenly don party hats and bellow with joy. \"They weren't used to saving them, because in life, they'd steal them after they got dirty or old. They have to live that way,\" said Affeldt, who posted a 2.70 ERA in 67 appearances last season before pitching 10 1\/3 shutout innings spanning 10 postseason outings.
