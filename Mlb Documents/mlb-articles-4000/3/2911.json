    "body": "Dodgers team president and CEO Stan Kasten has been named the 2013 Sports Executive of the Year by the Los Angeles Sports Council. He will be honored during the ninth annual LA Sports Awards, held March 5 at the Beverly Hilton Hotel. Previous honorees include the Angels' Arte Moreno (2011 and 2005) and the Dodgers' Ned Colletti (2006). The awards serve as a fundraiser for the nonprofit Los Angeles Sports Council, and proceeds will \"further its mission of promoting economic development through sports in the greater Los Angeles area.\" In his second year with the Dodgers last season, Kasten helped lead the club to the National League West title and the NL Championship Series for the first time in four years, where they fell to the Cardinals. \"He has helped to re-energize the team's fan base and re-establish the Dodgers as one of the leading brands in all of team sports, with a team built for long-term success on and off the field,\" a Los Angeles Sports Council release read.
