    "body": "LOS ANGELES -- Reckless driving charges against Dodgers outfielder Yasiel Puig have been dropped, but speeding charges remain after his December arrest in Florida. According to TMZ Sports, the state attorney's office won't pursue the reckless driving charges because of lack of sufficient evidence that he was driving with willful and wanton disregard for people or property. However, charges that Puig was driving 110 mph in a 70 mph zone remain. Puig was arrested driving a Mercedes on Alligator Alley in Florida. In the car were his mother, a cousin and a friend. Early last season, Puig was arrested in Chattanooga, Tenn., for driving 97 mph in a 50 mph zone. Those charges were dropped. Ken Gurnick is a reporter for MLB.com.
