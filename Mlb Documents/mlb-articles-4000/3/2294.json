    "body": "BALTIMORE -- The Orioles officially announced Friday that Delmon Young will return next season, as the outfielder\/designated hitter passed his physical. Young will make a base salary of $2.25 million in 2015 that could reach $3 million if he hits all of the incentives. Despite limited playing time, Young was a big piece for the Orioles. A non-roster invitee who made the Opening Day roster last spring, Young hit .302 with seven homers and 30 RBIs in 83 games. Young's pinch-hit three-run double in the American League Division Series lifted Baltimore to a Game 2 win over the Tigers on its way to a sweep. It was one of many clutch hits for the 29-year-old last season. Over a nine-year career with five clubs, Young is a .283 hitter with 107 homers and 550 RBIs. He is the only free agent retained by Baltimore this season, as the O's have already lost Nick Markakis, Andrew Miller, Nelson Cruz and Nick Hundley to other clubs. Executive vice president of baseball operations Dan Duquette had wanted to add an outfielder and both a right-handed and left-handed bat at last month's Winter Meetings. The club will continue to look for another outfielder to help cover for the departures of Cruz and Markakis, but Young's signing should help add depth and give manager Buck Showalter a good option in the DH role.
