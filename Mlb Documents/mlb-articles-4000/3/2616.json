    "body": "ST. PETERSBURG -- The Rays acquired Minor League catcher Mike Marjama from the White Sox on Thursday in exchange for a player to be named or cash. Marjama, 25, is not expected to attend Major League Spring Training. He played 70 games for Class A Advanced Winston-Salem last year, hitting .266\/.292\/.383 with three homers and 17 RBIs. Marjama should help fill out Tampa Bay's Minor League catching depth. A 23rd-round pick in the 2011 Draft, he has posted a .270\/.307\/.376 batting line in 223 games over four seasons in the Minors.
