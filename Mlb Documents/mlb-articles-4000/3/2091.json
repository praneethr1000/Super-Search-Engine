    "body": "ANAHEIM -- The Angels avoided arbitration with left-handers Hector Santiago and Cesar Ramos and catcher Drew Butera on Thursday. Santiago will receive $2.29 million in 2015, while Ramos will get $1,312,500 and Butera nets $987,500. Santiago posted a 3.75 ERA in 127 1\/3 innings in his first year with the Angels last season, adding a 1.36 WHIP and a 2.04 strikeout-to-walk ratio. This was the first of three arbitration years for the 27-year-old, who will compete for the fifth spot in the rotation in Spring Training. Ramos, acquired from the Rays for pitching prospect Mark Sappington this past November, has posted a 3.90 ERA, a 1.33 WHIP and a 1.95 strikeout-to-walk ratio in 150 innings the last two years. The 30-year-old was in his second year of arbitration, receiving a jump from $749,750 last year, and currently projects as the only lefty in the Angels' bullpen. Butera, acquired from the Dodgers for Minor League outfielder Matt Long on Dec. 9, was in his second arbitration year and got a raise from $700,000. The 31-year-old has batted .183\/.239\/.268 in 251 games the last five years, but he's thrown out 33 percent of would-be basestealers in that span and will compete for the backup job this spring. With Santiago, Ramos and Butera done, five arbitration-eligibles remain for the Angels: Garrett Richards, Matt Joyce, David Freese, Fernando Salas and Collin Cowgill. Figures are exchanged on Friday, with hearings to take place in February, if necessary. Alden Gonzalez is a reporter for MLB.com.
