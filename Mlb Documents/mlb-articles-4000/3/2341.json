    "body": "BOSTON -- If the Red Sox had dealt for a front-line pitcher this winter, they might have had to trade the five-tool talent of Mookie Betts. But the outfielder stayed put, and he was in Boston on Thursday night to collect an award -- the Minor League Player of the Year for the Red Sox in 2014. Trade rumors are something the 22-year-old Betts is already able to keep in perspective. \"I wouldn't say I'm a commodity. I try not to think about it too much,\" said Betts. \"I just want to put on a uniform -- whoever it is. I'd love to stay here with this great fanbase and everything. [I] just know that I'm still here, I'm really happy and I just have to go into Spring Training ready to play.\" Though Betts received an award for his feats in the Minors, he also accomplished plenty at the Major League level in 2014, hitting .291 with five homers and 18 RBIs in 189 at-bats. It remains to be seen how much playing time he will get in the coming season. \"I can't really worry about it,\" said Betts. \"That's [general manager] Ben [Cherington] and [manager] John [Farrell]'s job. I just know I can go in ready to play and help the team out in any way.\" Every time Betts was involved in a rumor, he had friends and family members keeping him updated. \"Pretty much all the time,\" said Betts. \"They try and keep up with all that stuff. I guess they want to play GM. They let me know the things that are going on. That's just what they do outside of baseball. Now I'm on the inside, so I know how everything works. I know I can't really worry about that.\" Ian Browne is a reporter for MLB.com. This story was not subject to the approval of Major League Baseball or its clubs.",
