    "body": "Ariel Prieto has been added to the Arizona Diamondbacks Major League staff as a coach and translator, as announced by D-backs senior vice president and general manager Dave Stewart on Monday. Prieto, 45, joins the D-backs after serving in the same capacity with the Oakland A's from 2012-14. The former Major League pitcher was instrumental in Yoenis Cespedes' transition to the United States upon his arrival from Cuba in 2012. He also has the ability to throw ambidextrous batting practice. The Cuba native spent six seasons in the Majors with Oakland (1995-2000) and Tampa Bay (2001), making 70 appearances (60 starts) with a 4.85 ERA. Prieto pitched for the Cuban National Team from 1990-94, and he went 11-0 in international play. He began his coaching career as pitching coach with the Rookie League Arizona A's in 2009.
