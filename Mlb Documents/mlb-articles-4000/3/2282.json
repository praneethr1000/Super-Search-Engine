    "body": "The Pirates are reportedly close to officially signing Korean shortstop Jung-ho Kang to a four-year deal. CBS Sports reported on Friday that the two sides are \"moving close to a deal\" as the Jan. 20 deadline approaches. The Pirates already spent $5 million as a fee to negotiate with Kang and his agent, Alan Nero. Nero told the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette on Wednesday that he was \"confident we'll come to an agreement\" on Kang, the power-hitting 27-year-old who reportedly is seeking a contract worth $5 million annually. Kang hit 40 homers and drove in 117 runs in 117 games while batting .356 with a 1.198 OPS for the Nexen Heroes in the Korean Baseball Organization last year. It's still unclear where Kang will fit in with Pittsburgh if the two sides complete a deal. He could back up Josh Harrison at third base, Jordy Mercer at shortstop and Neil Walker at second, and he could be a part of the mix at first base. Adam Berry is a reporter for MLB.com.
