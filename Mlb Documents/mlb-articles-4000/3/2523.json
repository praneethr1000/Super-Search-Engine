    "body": "Yoan Moncada, the 19-year-old Cuban sensation, has had a private workout for the Yankees. New York is among a growing list of clubs coveting the services of the switch-hitter who has been primarily a middle infielder, but may eventually wind up in the outfield. MLB.com's Jesse Sanchez confirmed a Baseball America report that Moncada showcased his skills for Yankees officials. Sanchez also notes Moncada has worked out for the Giants, and he said that Moncada had seven workouts scheduled for January. A number of high-revenue Major League clubs are scouting Moncada, who is expected to sign for more than $30 million. Before being free to sign, Moncada first must be cleared by the Office of Foreign Assets Control. Because Moncada is under age 23 and he has not played in a Cuban professional league for at least five seasons, he will be subject to the international signing guidelines. This means the bonus he will receive will come from a team's international bonus spending pool. Joe Frisaro is a reporter for MLB.com. He writes a blog, called The Fish Pond.
