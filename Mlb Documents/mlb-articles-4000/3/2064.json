    "body": "SAN DIEGO -- The Padres on Friday agreed to one-year contracts for the 2015 season with six players and a two-year deal through 2016 with Alexi Amarista, avoiding arbitration with all of their eligible players. The six players to agree to one-year deals for 2015 are right-handers Andrew Cashner, Shawn Kelley, Ian Kennedy, Tyson Ross and Dale Thayer, and infielder Yonder Alonso. \"We're happy to settle with everybody -- you go into the process hoping both sides can come up with an agreement,\" Padres general manager A.J. Preller said. Amarista, who will get the first crack at winning the shortstop job, has a two-year deal that will be worth $2.5 million. He appeared in a career-best 148 games for San Diego last season, posting career highs in several offensive categories. Kennedy will earn $9.85 million in 2015. The 30-year-old went 13-13 with a 3.63 ERA and a career-high 207 strikeouts in 33 starts last year. He'll be a free agent after this season. Cashner, the Padres' Opening Day starter last season, will make $4.05 million. He went 5-7 with a 2.55 ERA in 19 starts. Ross, an All-Star for the first time last season, will make $5.25 million. He turned in a breakout campaign, posting career highs in nearly every category. A year ago, the Padres went to an arbitration hearing with Cashner that he ultimately won. Thayer, who will make $1.375 million, appeared in a career-high 70 games last season. Alonso, who will make $1.65 million in 2015, hit .240 with 19 doubles, seven homers and 27 RBIs in 84 games in a season cut short by surgery to his right forearm. Kelley, who was acquired from the Yankees on Dec. 29 after going 3-6 with four saves and a 4.53 ERA a year ago, will make $2.835 million. Corey Brock is a reporter for MLB.com.
