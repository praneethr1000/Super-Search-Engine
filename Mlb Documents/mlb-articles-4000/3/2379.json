    "subtitle": "",
    "body": "The Astros and Marwin Gonzalez avoided arbitration and agreed to terms on a one-year, $1,062,500 contract on Friday. Gonzalez, 25, is coming off the best season of his young career, as he posted career highs in multiple categories, including at-bats (285) and batting average (.277). As a switch-hitter, Gonzalez not only gives the Astros flexibility offensively, but his versatility is valuable on the defensive end as well. In 2014, Gonzalez started 64 games at shortstop, five at second base and six at third base, while also seeing time at first base, left field and right field. With Gonzalez signed, the Astros have agreed to deals with all seven players who had been arbitration-eligible. William Boor is a reporter for MLB.com. Follow him on Twitter at @wboor.
