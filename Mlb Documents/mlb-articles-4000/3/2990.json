    "body": "You could script either story individually, and each would be a tantalizing tale that defines what we love so much about sport. The thrill of victory, the agony of defeat and a long road coming to a captivating coda.  But to pair the tales of the 2011 Cardinals and Rays together, to sell their stories as synchronized, would seemingly be going too far.  After all, who would believe it? Just a few weeks prior, the postseason slots in both leagues seemed all but certain. Even as the AL East began to slip from their hands, the Red Sox nonetheless held a firm hold on the Wild Card. And though the Braves never truly threatened the Phillies for the NL East top spot, they were so far removed from the Cardinals that their Wild Card also seemed a foregone conclusion.
