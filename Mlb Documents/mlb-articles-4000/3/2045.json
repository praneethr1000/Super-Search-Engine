    "body": "The Orioles outrighted Ryan Lavarnway to Triple-A Norfolk on Friday after the catcher cleared waivers. It's been a tumultuous offseason for Lavarnway, who has been designated for assignment by four teams and claimed by three. He went from the Red Sox to the Dodgers to the Cubs and finally to the Orioles, who designated him last week to make room on the 40-man roster for Delmon Young. This time, no club claimed the 27-year-old, and he will remain in the Baltimore organization. A sixth-round pick by the Red Sox in the 2008 First-Year Player Draft, Lavarnway has spent some time with Boston in each of the past four seasons, hitting .201\/.249\/.315 with five home runs and 34 RBIs over 301 plate appearances. He went 0-for-10 for the Red Sox in 2014, spending most of his time at Triple-A Pawtucket, where he hit .283 with a .759 OPS. Andrew Simon is a reporter for MLB.com.
