    "body": "Omar Lopez, the manager of the Astros' Class A Advanced Lancaster affiliate, has been named the Manager of the Year in the Venezuelan Professional Baseball League for the 2014-15 season. Lopez, who at 38 was the youngest manager in the league this season, led the Caribes de Anzoategui to a league-best 39-24 regular-season record in his first year as manager. He served as manager of the Astros' Class A affiliate in Quad Cities last year, and will take over the Lancaster club this season. \"Omar is one of the brightest young managers we have in our Minor League system, and has done an exceptional job developing our players both on and off the field of play,\" Astros director of player development Quinton McCracken said in a statement. \"Omar is a good baseball tactician, a stern but fair leader of men, and has an excellent knack for getting his players to reach their full potential within a team concept. He has overseen the development of many players throughout his time with the Astros, including All-Star second baseman Jose Altuve. On behalf of the Astros organization, we congratulate Omar on this well-deserved honor.\" Lopez became the third manager in the history of the Caribes club to win the honor, taking home 47 of the 50 first place votes. He has been a member of the Astros' organization since 1999, and a manager in the Houston Minor League system the last seven seasons. Joey Nowak is a reporter for MLB.com.
