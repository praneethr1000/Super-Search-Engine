    "subtitle": "Pirates outfielder, ranked No. 12 in '09, leapfrogs others in his class en route to star status",
    "body": "The 2005 Draft was loaded with dynamic high school outfielders, including Justin Upton (No. 1 overall pick), Cameron Maybin (No. 10), Jay Bruce (No. 12) and Colby Rasmus (No. 28). In 2009, we still had Rasmus and Maybin ranked slightly ahead of Andrew McCutchen (No. 11 pick in '05) in our prospect rankings -- Upton and Bruce were already in the Majors -- but he earned a promotion after destroying Triple-A in 49 games in '09, and has had the most distinguished career of the group ever since. As we gear up for the unveiling of MLB.com's Top 100 Prospects for 2015 -- which will be revealed on MLB Network and MLB.com at 9 p.m. ET on Friday -- we're looking back at what was written about some of today's superstars back when they were still on prospect lists. Andrew McCutchen, OF, Pirates No. 12 on 2009 Top 50  WHEN THEY WERE PROSPECTS Statistically speaking: McCutchen finished eighth among Triple-A hitters with 34 stolen bases, though he also led that group by being caught 19 times. He finished extremely strong, hitting .324 with a .415 OBP and seven steals in August. Scouting report: He's a five-tool player with terrific athletic ability to go along with plus bat speed and good pitch recognition. The development of his power will determine whether he's a leadoff hitter or an eventual run producer. He has outstanding speed and is an excellent defensive center fielder, but is still learning the nuances of basestealing. Upside potential: Everyday center fielder and impact player in the big leagues. They said it: \"Andrew more than held his own at Triple-A for being the youngest player on the field most nights. He controlled the strike zone, improved defensively and made some strides in other areas of the game. His athleticism allows him to be very good, but he's challenged himself to be better than that by improving at the little things. We're excited about his future in Pittsburgh.\" -- Pirates farm director Kyle Stark. He said it: \"I'm not satisfied with it, but I'm pleased with it. I know I can improve, and I know I can do better. I just need to crisp it up a little more and be ready.\" -- McCutchen on his 2008 season.",
