    "body": "Phillies Minor Leaguer Christopher O'Hare has been suspended for 50 games without pay after a second positive test for a drug of abuse in violation of the Minor League Drug Prevention and Treatment Program. The 23-year-old left-hander was a 23rd-round pick of the Phillies in the 2013 First-Year Player Draft out of Fisher College in Boston, and he made five appearances last season between Rookie ball, Class A Advanced Clearwater and Class A Lakewood. He allowed five hits and two runs in five innings, walking two and striking out six. O'Hare is currently on the Lakewood roster, and his suspension will be effective at the start of the team's 2014 season. Joey Nowak is a reporter for MLB.com. Follow him on Twitter at @joeynowak.
