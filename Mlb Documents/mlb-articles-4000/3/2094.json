    "body": "LOS ANGELES -- The Dodgers and outfielder Chris Heisey reached a Thursday agreement on a one-year contract for $2.16 million, avoiding salary arbitration. Heisey earned $1.76 million last year for the Reds, who traded him to the Dodgers Dec. 2 for pitcher Matt Magill. Heisey figures to be a platoon center fielder and right-handed pinch-hitter for the Dodgers this season. The settlement leaves the Dodgers with three players eligible for arbitration -- closer Kenley Jansen, pitcher Juan Nicasio and infielder Justin Turner. In 2014, Jansen earned $4.3 million, Nicasio $2.025 million and Turner $1.225 million. Binding salary figures are to be exchanged on Friday, and new president of baseball operations Andrew Friedman has said the club will go to a hearing with any player who has not settled by that time. The Dodgers previously were willing to negotiate up to the hearing, after which an arbitration panel selects one figure or the other as the player's 2015 salary.
