    "body": "HOUSTON -- The Astros hired Tarrik Brock as their new first-base coach on Wednesday, replacing Eduardo Perez, who told the club last week he was resigning to spend more time with his family. Perez, who served last season as the Astros' bench coach, was set to be their third-base coach this season. Pat Listach, who was hired last year to coach first base, will move to third. Brock spent the past seven seasons as the Marlins' Minor League outfield and baserunning coordinator and also spent part of 2010 as the big league club's interim first-base coach. The 40-year-old worked with Astros manager Bo Porter from 2006-09 with the Marlins. Brock began his coaching career after playing 13 seasons in the Minors as an outfielder, including a brief Major League stint with the Cubs in 2000. Perez joined the Astros prior to last season as Porter's bench coach. Dave Trembley, who was the third-base coach last year, will be the bench coach this season. Following last season, the Astros named Brent Strom pitching coach, Craig Bjornson as bullpen coach and Ralph Dickenson as assistant hitting coach. Listach was hired to coach first, but he'll move across the diamond to third in the wake of Perez's departure. John Mallee is returning as hitting coach for the second year.
