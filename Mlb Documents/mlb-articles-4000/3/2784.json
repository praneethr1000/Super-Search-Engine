    "body": "The Orioles agreed to one-year contracts with right-hander Bud Norris and infielder Ryan Flaherty on Monday, avoiding arbitration with two of their six remaining arbitration-eligible players. Norris will make $8.8 million, while Flaherty will make $1.075 million, a source told MLB.com. Norris, now in his final season of arbitration, made $5.3 million in 2014. He filed for a salary of $10.25 million and the O's submitted a $7.5 million proposal. Norris posted a 15-8 record with a 3.65 ERA in 28 starts for Baltimore, walking 52 and striking out 139 over 165 1\/3 innings. The six-year veteran, who will turn 30 in March, is 53-57 with a 4.23 ERA over six seasons for the Astros and Orioles. His deal includes performance bonuses of $25,000 for 180 innings pitched and $50,000 each for 200 innings pitched, an All-Star selection or a Gold Glove Award. Flaherty initially filed for a salary of $1.5 million while the O's countered at $900,000 when figures were exchanged last week. The deal includes a $25,000 incentive if Flaherty makes 400 plate appearances and an extra $50,000 each for making the All-Star team, winning a Gold Glove or being named the Most Valuable Player in the League Championship Series or World Series. Flaherty, 28, appeared in 102 games at six positions for the Orioles in 2014, beginning the season by filling in for an injured Manny Machado at third base, making 29 starts at second and replacing J.J. Hardy at shortstop while he recovered. Flaherty batted .221\/.288\/.356 with seven homers and 32 RBIs. Baltimore now has four additional arbitration cases it has yet to resolve: Alejandro De Aza, Miguel Gonzalez, Steve Pearce and Zach Britton. Jamal Collier is a reporter for MLB.com.
