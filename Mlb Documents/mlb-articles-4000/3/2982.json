    "body": "MILWAUKEE -- Nyjer Morgan needs another alter ego, and Brewers fans on Twitter were more than happy to help.  Tony Puck.  Sergei Plushkov. Morgan, a Bay Area native who grew up playing hockey, remains an avid fan. But he gave up on the sport about a decade ago to focus on baseball, a choice that took him and his alter egos all the way to the Major Leagues and a spot in Brewers history after delivering the hit that propelled the team to last year's National League Championship Series. He's already re-signed for 2012, but Brewers position players don't have their first Spring Training workout until Feb. 25. That gives Morgan a chance to lace up his skates.
