    "body": "SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. -- Jamey Carroll, whose 12-year career as a versatile and vagabond infielder ended last year, has joined the Pirates' expanding baseball-operations department to begin a new career. Carroll was hired Monday as a special assistant. The 40-year-old becomes the second former player added to the staff, joining former Pirates first baseman Kevin Young, who was added last month. Carroll never played for the Bucs, but he played for six other clubs while logging 1,276 games at every position with the exception of first base and catcher. He saw most of his action at second base, where in 2006-07, he batted .275 in 244 games for the Colorado Rockies managed by Clint Hurdle. Former big league manager Grady Little was also added to baseball operations in December as a senior adviser. Tom Singer is a reporter for MLB.com and writes an MLBlog Change for a Nickel.
