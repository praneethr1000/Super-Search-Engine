    "body": "BOSTON -- The Red Sox agreed to terms on one-year, non-guaranteed contracts with starting pitcher Rick Porcello and righty reliever Junichi Tazawa, avoiding arbitration with both players. Porcello, the sinkerballing righty who was acquired from the Tigers in a trade for Yoenis Cespeces, signed a $12.5 million contract. The deal with Tazawa, an indispensable part of Boston's bullpen the last three seasons, is for $2.25 million. That leaves lefty Wade Miley and outfielder Daniel Nava as the club's two remaining arbitration-eligible players. Miley, who came to the Red Sox in a trade from the D-backs back in December, submitted an arbitration figure of $4.3 million while Boston countered at $3.4 million. Nava is requesting $2.25 million while the Red Sox submitted an offer of $1.3 million. The Red Sox have not had an arbitration hearing with a player since Rolando Arrojo in 2002.
