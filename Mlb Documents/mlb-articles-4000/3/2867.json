    "subtitle": "Chicago avoids arbitration with new outfielder, acquired in Bogusevic trade",
    "body": "The Cubs avoided another arbitration hearing on Wednesday by signing outfielder Justin Ruggiano to a one-year, $2 million contract for 2014. The $2 million salary is almost exactly halfway between the $2.45 million he filed for, and the Cubs' $1.6 million offer. The Cubs acquired Ruggiano, who made $494,500 last year, from the Marlins in a trade for Brian Bogusevic. Ruggiano posted a .222\/.298\/.396 batting line with 18 homers, 50 RBIs and 15 stolen bases in 128 games for Miami in 2013. In parts of five Major League seasons, the 31-year-old outfielder owns a .251\/.315\/.432 batting line and has played all three outfield positions. He was at his best with the Marlins in 2012, batting .313\/.374\/.535 with 13 homers and 36 RBIs in 91 games. The Cubs have two arbitration-eligible players remaining: second baseman Darwin Barney and right-hander Jeff Samardzija. If the club can't reach an agreement before then, arbitration hearings will take place from Feb. 1-21. Adam Berry is a reporter for MLB.com. Follow him on Twitter at @adamdberry.
