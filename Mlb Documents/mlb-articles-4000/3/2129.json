    "body": "CHICAGO -- Paul Konerko will become the 11th player to have his jersey number retired by the White Sox when the franchise icon is honored during a special pregame tribute before the first pitch of a 3:10 p.m. CT game against the Twins on Saturday, May 23, at U.S. Cellular Field. Fans get to celebrate Konerko's 16 seasons with the White Sox -- a run that came to an end for the captain after the 2014 campaign -- while the first 20,000 in attendance will receive a replica Konerko statue presented by XFINITY. \"Paul Konerko is one of the greatest players in White Sox history, not only for his strength and performance on the field, but also for his heart and leadership off the field,\" said White Sox chairman Jerry Reinsdorf of Konerko. \"Paul was a humble leader whose passion for the game earned the respect and love of the entire clubhouse and fans all over the country. We honor Paul by retiring his number and welcoming him to the ranks of White Sox legends.\" Konerko's No. 14 joins Nellie Fox (No. 2), Harold Baines (No. 3), Luke Appling (No. 4), Minnie Minoso (No. 9), Luis Aparicio (No. 11), Ted Lyons (No. 16), Billy Pierce (No. 19), Frank Thomas (No. 35), Carlton Fisk (No. 72) and Dodgers Hall of Famer Jackie Robinson (No. 42) on the White Sox retired numbers list. The six-time American League All-Star is the franchise leader in total bases (4,010) and ranks among White Sox leaders in virtually every offensive category. Konerko (432) finished 16 homers behind Thomas (448), for the club record, while ranking third in hits (2,292) and doubles (406). He was the starting first baseman on the 2005 World Series championship team and launched a memorable grand slam off Houston reliever Chad Qualls in Game 2 of the four-game sweep. Konerko's 50 career homers hit against the Twins represent his largest total against one team, so the opposition for this special day seems fitting. The planned jersey retirement was announced during Konerko's retirement tribute ceremony on Sept. 27, 2014, when a statue of the captain was unveiled, among other gifts. Tickets to the Paul Konerko No. 14 Retirement Day are available now through Pick 7 and Pick 14 ticket plans as well as in group sale packages. Tickets for the 2015 season can be purchased at whitesox.com. There's also an opportunity for fans to remember Konerko's career with the limited edition book from Chicago White Sox Charities titled \"Paul Konerko: Farewell to a Friend.\" The 50-plus page book highlights Konerko's 14 greatest moments and provides a recap of his emotional final weekend in a White Sox uniform. The book is available for $35 (plus $5 shipping\/handling fee) through whitesox.com\/PKbook. Proceeds from the sale of the book benefit Chicago White Sox Charities.
