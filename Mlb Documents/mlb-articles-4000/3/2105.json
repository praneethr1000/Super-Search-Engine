    "body": "WASHINGTON -- Nationals right-handers Doug Fister, Stephen Strasburg and Drew Storen avoided arbitration Friday by signing one-year deals for the 2015 season. Strasburg will make $7.4 million, while Storen will earn $5.7 million, baseball sources confirmed to MLB.com. Fister will make $11.4 million, according to CBSSports.com. Washington's Opening Day starter the past three seasons, Strasburg, 26, was in his second year of arbitration eligibility. He is coming off arguably his best season, winning 14 games and tying for the National League lead with 242 strikeouts. Storen was also in his second year of arbitration eligibility. The right-hander recaptured the closer role the last month of the 2014 season, saving 10 games without allowing an earned run. Fister led the Nationals in victories with 16, even though he missed the first month of the season with a lat strain, and had been mentioned as offseason trade bait. With Strasburg, Storen and Fister signed, only Jerry Blevins remains eligible for arbitration. Bill Ladson is a reporter for MLB.com and writes an MLBlog, All Nats All the time.
