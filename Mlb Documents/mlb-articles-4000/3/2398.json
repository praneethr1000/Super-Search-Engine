    "body": "CHICAGO -- The White Sox expect approximately 16,750 autographs to be signed and 3,425 photos to be taken by and with their players during weekend SoxFest activities starting Friday afternoon at the Hilton Chicago. But the sold-out festivities will feature more than these usual staples. Earlier Wednesday, the full SoxFest schedule was released with the opening ceremony running from 4-4:45 p.m. CT. Friday. Friday seminars begin at 5 p.m. with the 2015 White Sox, a town hall meeting of sorts with general manager Rick Hahn and manager Robin Ventura. White Sox chairman Jerry Reinsdorf will be part of the Don't Stop Believin' seminar at 7 p.m., joined by executive vice president Ken Williams and Geoff Blum, Joe Crede and Bobby Jenks from the 2005 World Series team. This weekend officially begins the 10-year anniversary celebration of the White Sox World Series championship. A panel with top prospects Tim Anderson, Courtney Hawkins, Micah Johnson and Carlos Rodon starts at 6 p.m., while the final Friday panel features hitting coach Todd Steverson, assistant hitting coach Harold Baines, Adam Eaton, Tyler Flowers and Conor Gillaspie on the mental approach to hitting at 8 p.m. Jose Abreu signs autographs at 5 p.m. and poses for photos at 7 p.m. on Day 1, with Friday serving as the only day he will be in attendance. Abreu will be traveling to New York on Saturday for the BBWAA dinner where he will be honored as the American League Rookie of the Year. Saturday's event run from 9 a.m.- 4 p.m., while Sunday runs from 9 a.m.-3 p.m. Another town hall meeting with Hahn and Ventura takes place at 10 a.m. on Saturday, with two seminars devoted to 2005 on Saturday and one more on Sunday.
