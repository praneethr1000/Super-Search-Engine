    "body": "Royals general manager Dayton Moore says the idea of re-signing free-agent starting pitcher James Shields has crossed his mind, but \"at this point in time, it's doubtful.\" Moore was on MLB Network Radio's Power Alley with Mike Ferrin And Jim Duquette, and touched on the issue of the Royals' starting rotation -- sans Shields -- heading into Spring Training. \"We feel right now that we're probably who we are going into Spring Training,\" Moore said. \"You never say never, but right now, with the addition of Edinson Volquez and rounding out our rotation and replacing James Shields, we feel that our rotation's going to be very solid. It's going to give us guys that compete and utilize our defense.\" Volquez, 31, signed a two-year deal with the Royals on Dec. 29 worth $17 million, and that deal also has a $10 million team option for 2017 and a $3 million buyout. Volquez went 13-7 with a 3.04 ERA with the Pirates last season. \"With Volquez, he obviously had a terrific year in 2014, and we feel he's certainly capable of that going forward,\" Moore said.
