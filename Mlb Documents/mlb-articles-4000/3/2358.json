    "body": "Trade talks between the Phillies and Brewers regarding closer Jonathan Papelbon have \"dissipated,\" Brewers general manager Doug Melvin told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel on Saturday. \"It doesn't appear there's any momentum to it right now,\" Melvin told the newspaper. \"It could be revived later, I guess, but right now there's nothing happening. \"Whatever traction there was seems to have dissipated.\" The biggest hang-ups, according to the report, are Papelbon's contract and his no-trade clause. The right-handed closer can block deals to 17 teams, one of which includes Milwaukee. He is also due a $13-million option for 2016 should he finish 48 games. Papelbon has finished at least 48 games in every year but his rookie season. The potential for a deal is not yet off the table, a source told CSNPhilly.com, but those issues complicate it. Papelbon, 34, has 325 saves in 10 seasons with the Red Sox and Phillies. Cash Kruth is a reporter for MLB.com. Follow him on Twitter at @cashkruth.
