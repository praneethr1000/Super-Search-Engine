    "body": "HOUSTON -- Andrew Walter, a right-hander who split last season between Class A Quad Cities and Class A Advanced Lancaster, received a 50-game suspension without pay on Wednesday following a second positive test for a drug of abuse in violation of the Minor League Drug Prevention and Treatment Program. The suspension of Walter will be effective at the start of the 2015 California League season. Walter, 24, went a combined 4-5 with a 3.46 ERA in 40 games, including 33 at Quad Cities. He was signed by the Astros as a non-drafted free agent in 2011 out of Yavapai Community College in Arizona. Brian McTaggart is a reporter for MLB.com and writes an MLBlog, Tag's Lines.
