    "body": "TORONTO -- The Blue Jays' offseason was put up for review on Monday night in front of a large group of season-ticket holders at the club's annual State of the Franchise at Rogers Centre.  President Paul Beeston, general manager Alex Anthopoulos and manager John Farrell were on hand to field questions from the nearly 1,000 fans in attendance. It was an opportunity for the most loyal Blue Jays followers from the Greater Toronto Area to get answers about the direction of the team.  The tone was mostly positive, with the exception of a few confrontational questions, but it was nothing new to Anthopoulos, who has been down this road before and anticipated being put under a microscope.
