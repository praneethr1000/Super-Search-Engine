    "body": "WASHINGTON -- The Nationals have signed infielder\/outfielder Mike Carp and catcher Steven Lerud to Minor League deals with invitations to Spring Training, the team announced on Tuesday. Carp is a player who could help improve the bench. His best season came with the Red Sox in 2013, when he hit .296 with nine home runs, 43 RBIs and a .362 on-base percentage. Carp played left field and first base while helping Boston win a World Series title that year. The Nationals added depth behind the plate by acquiring Lerud, who spent last year in the Braves' organization. He spent the entire season with Triple-A Gwinnett, hitting .250 with four home runs and 19 RBIs. Lerud has big league experience, having played nine games for the Phillies in 2012-13.
