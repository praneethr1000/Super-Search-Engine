    "body": "CLEVELAND -- Mark Shapiro sat in an airport on Wednesday morning, awaiting a flight to Arizona for a quick business stop out in the desert. Come Sunday, the Indians president will be back at Progressive Field, hoping for a perfect mix of cold and snow.  Cleveland's home ballpark has already been transformed into a winter playground for the organization's Snow Days event, but Sunday will mark the first outdoor college hockey game in the history of Ohio. The Frozen Diamond Faceoff will feature nationally ranked rivals in Ohio State and Michigan.  Buckeyes against Wolverines. Scarlet and gray against maize and blue. \"Oh, yeah,\" Shapiro said. \"I'm looking forward to it.\"   The Faceoff is the signature event for this offseason's \"Snow Days,\" which has seen a dip in attendance from last winter's showing due to the warmer weather conditions of the past two months. Fortunately, the current forecast calls for the temperature to drop just below freezing with a light snow possible for Sunday.   That could create an atmosphere that makes for a classic contest.   Cleveland already enjoyed a preview of Sunday's event with the Jan. 5 on-ice clash between local high schools, St. Ignatius and St. Edward. St. Ignatius' hockey team took that tilt with a 4-2 victory and also provided a glimpse of what Sunday's environment might be like in the process.   \"What was clear with the high school game,\" Shapiro said, \"was how exciting it is to watch outdoor hockey, and really the potential impact of a big event like the Ohio State-Michigan Frozen Diamond Faceoff. It was a treat to have great local teams playing multiple games. It was neat to see those kids and their families enjoying that.   \"But more than anything, it whet our appetite to see what the ballpark packed watching hockey would be like. That's the atmosphere we know we're going to have come Sunday.\"   In the latest USA Today\/American Hockey Magazine rankings, Ohio State and Michigan were ranked second and 15th in the country, respectively. The Frozen Diamond Faceoff will be the second in a two-game series between the teams, beginning with a game on Jan. 13 in Columbus, Ohio.   The Faceoff is scheduled to begin at 5:05 p.m. ET with postgame fireworks planned.

Events such as the high school and hockey games were important additions to Snow Days, which is in its second year. Last offseason, the event drew more than 50,000 customers, but the Tribe ultimately suffered a financial loss -- something that was expected in the program's first year.   Shapiro did not delve into detailed projections about how Snow Days (ending Monday) might fare this winter. Instead, the team's president focused on the thought process behind the event, which is to continue to explore ways to offer fans more than just baseball throughout the year.   \"It's continually important for us to look for new ways to utilize our facility,\" Shapiro said, \"to share the special atmosphere of Progressive Field with the city and the region, and to bring new people into the ballpark and create new revenue. With the hockey game, as well as Snow Days and other things, we're trying and testing to accomplish that.   \"We've had some challenges with the weather. Attendance is below what we had hoped for and expected, but we've had really good customer feedback that the adjustments we made have been positive. All in all, after battling some significant weather challenges, it's been a good event again.\"   Hopefully, the weather will cooperate on Sunday.   \"As long as we don't have rain or a driving snow, we'll be fine,\" Shapiro said.
