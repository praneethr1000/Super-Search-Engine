    "body": "ARLINGTON -- The Rangers expect that they will be able to announce sometime on Wednesday that they have signed Japanese pitcher Yu Darvish. They are not expected to announce who will lose his spot in the rotation. They will probably wait until Spring Training before moving Alexi Ogando back to the bullpen.  \"My wish is to stay as a starter,\" Ogando said Tuesday. \"But if it happens I have to go to the bullpen, I'll be OK with that. I will do what it takes to help the team. I will be up for it.\"  The Rangers have not announced anything yet. They have until 4 p.m. CT on Wednesday to reach an agreement with Darvish. If they don't, Darvish will pitch in Japan again this season, and the Rangers will likely turn their attention to free-agent first baseman Prince Fielder. T.R. Sullivan is a reporter for MLB.com.
