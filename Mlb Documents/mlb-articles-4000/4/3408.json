    "body": "NEW YORK -- R.A. Dickey posted a lower ERA than all but nine starting pitchers in baseball last season, and yet his compensation for next season will not entirely reflect that. No matter. For a man who had never inked his name to a multiyear contract and who once had his generous Draft signing bonus stripped from him, the two-year, $7.8 million contract Dickey signed Monday was a boon.  \"My goal at this point is to be the best bargain in baseball for the next three years,\" Dickey said on a conference call Monday afternoon. \"To win championships, you really have to have an altruistic approach in that I wasn't out to break the bank from the get-go. If I want to be part of the solution here -- and I do -- giving some things up might help the collective good. I was willing to do that for this organization, and still am.\"  Dickey's deal buys out his first year of free agency and gives the Mets an option to retain him for $5 million in 2013. From the team's standpoint, the deal represents a risk -- signing a 36-year-old pitcher with only one successful season usually is. But if Dickey comes even close to duplicating his successes of last year, he will be a bargain. \"The knuckleball is a unique talent,\" general manager Sandy Alderson said, \"and something that can play very well later in a pitcher's career.\"   Noted knuckleballer Tim Wakefield has won 94 games for the Red Sox since turning 36. Charlie Hough won 132 games after his 36th birthday. Phil Niekro won 188.   Dickey, who won't turn 37 until October, was 11-9 with a 2.84 ERA in his first full big league season, spending most of the previous 13 years bouncing between the Majors and Minors. He posted career bests last season in wins, starts (26), ERA, innings (174 1\/3), strikeouts (104), complete games (two) and opponents' batting average (.251).
