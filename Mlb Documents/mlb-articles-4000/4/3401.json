    "body": "ARLINGTON -- The Super Bowl is coming to Arlington just as the Rangers' offseason is seemingly coming to a close.  The football comparison may be appropriate at this point, because Texas' tumultuous winter has taken on the characteristics of an NFL quarterback -- Aaron Rodgers seems to be a good candidate -- who is trying to drive his team the length of the field for the winning score in the waning moments of a game.  It has been quite a drive, with near-interceptions and penalties, incomplete passes and quarterback sacks. But the savvy quarterback also knows how to use audibles to change the play at the line of scrimmage while taking advantage of misdirection, obfuscation and play-action, and dodging tacklers by scrambling at will, improvising on the move and throwing on the run.
