    "body": "Prospective ownership groups led by former Dodgers manager Joe Torre and former Los Angeles Lakers great and basketball Hall of Famer Magic Johnson are among at least eight finalists in the bidding to become the next owners of the Dodgers, according to a report by The Los Angeles Times on Friday.  According to the report, Blackstone Advisory Partners, which is handling the sale of the team for current owner Frank McCourt, began notifying bidders Friday if they would continue in the process. Along with the groups headed by Torre and Johnson, other big names who made the next cut are groups led by developer Rick Caruso and hedge fund manager Steven Cohen, according to the Times.  In all, MLB has agreed to approve up to 10 bidders. Major League Baseball Commissioner Bud Selig, speaking at SoxFest in Chicago on Friday, said MLB was aware of the number of bidders and expected continued interest in the Dodgers, one of the game's oldest and most storied franchises.   \"That's up to Blackstone,\" Selig said when asked if bids were still being accepted. \"I think there's 10 or 11 groups right now. There's plenty of competition.\"   According to the Times, McCourt has agreed to identify the winning bidder by April 1.  Cash Kruth is a reporter for MLB.com. Follow him on Twitter at @cashkruth.
