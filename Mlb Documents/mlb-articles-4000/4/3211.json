    "body": "ST. LOUIS -- Hours before taking the field against the New England Patriots on Saturday night, Tim Tebow found himself the center of discussion in the Cardinals' interview room. Yes, these days it seems as if there is no setting that the Broncos quarterback can't effectively infiltrate.  Putting his Southeastern Conference allegiance aside, Adam Wainwright spent several minutes expressing his admiration for Tebow, particularly for the fearless the University of Florida product shows in expressing his religious faith in a public forum.  \"I am obsessed with Tim Tebow,\" Wainwright said. \"I'm not afraid to say it. It's almost embarrassing to us athletes that this much emphasis is put on Tim Tebow because that means we aren't living our lives as we should. If we did that more often, the way he is living wouldn't be as big a story. I'm so proud of him for living out his faith.\" A devout Christian himself, Wainwright went so far as to call Tebow his favorite athlete.   \"Tim Tebow is such a great role model,\" Wainwright said. \"I feel like he's the face of sports right now, and rightfully so. He gives the whole nation something to believe in. It's a story of hope.\"",
