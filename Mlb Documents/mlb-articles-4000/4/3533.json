    "body": "Three promising young players infused into the Astros' system last summer find themselves on an impressive list this winter. First baseman Jonathan Singleton, right-hander Jarred Cosart and outfielder George Springer are all included on MLB.com's annual Top Prospects list for 2012. Singleton ranks 44th, Cosart is 61st and Springer is 84th on the list. The list, which is one of several prospect rankings on MLB.com's Prospect Watch, only includes players with rookie status in 2012. This year's edition of MLB.com's Top Prospects list has expanded from 50 to 100 players. The annual ranking of baseball's biggest and brightest young talent is assembled by MLB.com's Draft and prospect expert Jonathan Mayo, who compiles input from industry sources, including scouts and scouting directors. It is based on analysis of players' skill sets, upsides, proximity to the Majors and potential immediate impact to their teams. Now, with Singleton and Cosart aboard as acquisitions in the Hunter Pence trade, and Springer having been taken with the 11th overall pick in the First-Year Player Draft, they are considered key pieces in the farm system of a club rebuilding from the ground up.
