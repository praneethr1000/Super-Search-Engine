    "body": "BOSTON -- A monster 2011 season has landed Jacoby Ellsbury a sizable raise. The Red Sox avoided salary arbitration with their star center fielder by signing him to a one-year contract worth $8.05 million.  That is a nice bump for Ellsbury, who earned $2.4 million last year.  Boston general manager Ben Cherington said that a multiyear deal was not discussed with Ellsbury. The Red Sox control Ellsbury's contractual rights for the 2013 season as well. After that, he can become a free agent unless the sides agree to a long-term deal. Ian Browne is a reporter for MLB.com. Read his blog, Brownie Points, and follow him on Twitter @IanMBrowne.
