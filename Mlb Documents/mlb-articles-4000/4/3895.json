    "body": "NEW YORK -- Rich \"Goose\" Gossage will be enshrined in the National Baseball Hall of Fame as a member of the New York Yankees, it was revealed at a press conference to introduce Gossage as a member of baseball's most elite fraternity on Wednesday.  And just to accentuate the point, Hall officials produced a plastic, long-necked white goose wearing a Hall of Fame jersey. Jane Forbes Clark, the chairman of the Hall, topped it off with a mini dark-blue Yankees batting helmet, replete with the silver interlocking NY on the front.  The stunt was the brainchild of Jeff Idelson, the Hall's vice president of communications, Clark said. Barry M. Bloom is a national reporter for MLB.com.
