    "body": "So Khloe reportedly isn't really a Kardashian, Mitt Romney reportedly isn't really the Iowa caucus winner and Fausto Carmona reportedly isn't really Fausto Carmona.  Talk about a jarring news cycle.  I've known The Pitcher Formerly Known as Carmona, who was arrested in the Dominican Republic for falsifying his identity, since he was 22 years old. I wonder now what it must be like to live a lie like that. \"I'm very proud of what I've accomplished,\" Carmona told me the day he signed that extension, and pride is precisely what prompted him to respond to any inquiry about a poor performance with a shake of the head and a proclamation that he had made \"a good pitch\" that the opposition happened to hit. Pride is the reason Carmona has always wanted to handle his own interviews with the American media, even though his English is dreadful.         If Carmona\/Heredia is guilty, was he wrong to tell this lie?   Well, from our first cognizant moments, we're all taught not to lie. But having bettered his own life and the lives of his loved ones, I doubt this lie -- a lie told by countless players in his position -- is one he'd regret, if he did indeed tell it.   What he'd regret, I'm sure, is getting caught. Anthony Castrovince is a reporter for MLB.com. Read his columns and his blog, CastroTurf, and follow him on Twitter at @Castrovince.
