    "body": "NEW YORK -- The Yankees and outfielder Brett Gardner avoided arbitration on Friday, agreeing to a one-year non-guaranteed contract, the club announced.  The club and Gardner, 28, met at the midpoint of arbitration figures exchanged earlier in the week, finalizing a $2.8 million deal. Gardner had requested $3.2 million and the club countered with $2.4 million.  Gardner is coming off a year in which he hit .259 with a .345 on-base percentage, 49 stolen bases and eight triples in 159 games for the Yankees as their primary left fielder, earning $529,500. His 49 stolen bases tied Oakland's Coco Crisp for the most in the American League. Gardner has hit .264 with 135 stolen bases in 163 attempts (82.8 percent) in his four-year career, all in New York. The Yankees expect to have Gardner as their starting left fielder in 2012, though Andruw Jones may replace him for some games against left-handed pitching.   His 49 steals last season, coupled with his 47 swipes in 2010, make Gardner one of only three Yankees -- joining Fritz Maisel (1914-15) and Rickey Henderson (1985-86) -- to record consecutive seasons with at least 45 stolen bases.   Two Yankees players remain eligible for arbitration. Catcher Russell Martin filed for $8.2 million, while New York offered $7 million; left-hander Boone Logan asked for $2.1 million and was met with a $1.7 million offer.   The Yankees have also avoided arbitration with pitchers Joba Chamberlain, Phil Hughes and David Robertson. Players and teams who go to arbitration hearings will engage in that process from Feb. 1-21 in St. Petersburg, Fla. Bryan Hoch is a reporter for MLB.com.
