    "body": "ARLINGTON -- The Rangers, while focused on signing pitcher Yu Darvish, have not shut down all other business. They are still discussing long-term contracts for certain players they have identified as being ones they want to keep for an extended period of time.  Catcher Mike Napoli, who can be a free agent after this season, is one of those players, but a long-term extension is not likely at this point. General manager Jon Daniels admitted Wednesday afternoon that the two sides were too far apart and most likely it will be a one-year deal for Napoli, who is eligible for arbitration.  \"We love Mike and we're not closing the door on anything, but right now we are focused on a one-year deal,\" Daniels said.
