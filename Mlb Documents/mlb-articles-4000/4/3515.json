    "body": "WASHINGTON -- The Nationals agreed to terms on Tuesday with right-hander Jordan Zimmermann and relievers Tom Gorzelanny and Tyler Clippard on 2012 contracts, thus avoiding salary arbitration. Terms of the deals were not disclosed.  Zimmermann made a nice comeback after recovering from Tommy John surgery and became the team's best starter in 2011. He won eight games and had a 3.18 ERA.  Gorzelanny prefers to start, but he has found his niche as a long reliever. Gorzelanny had a 2.42 ERA in that role this past season. Clippard was clearly Washington's best pitcher in 2011, appearing in 72 games with a 1.83 ERA. He also made his first All-Star appearance last July.  The Nats have two players -- John Lannan and Michael Morse -- who remain eligible for arbitration.   Lannan had a comeback season in 2011, going 10-13 with a 3.70 ERA, while making $2.75 million.   Morse, who made $1.05 million last year, was the Nationals' Most Valuable Player, hitting .303 with 31 home runs and 95 RBIs, while playing first base and left field.
