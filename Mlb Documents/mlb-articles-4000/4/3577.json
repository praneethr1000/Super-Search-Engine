    "body": "TORONTO -- The Blue Jays further solidified the back end of their bullpen on Wednesday afternoon by officially signing free agent Francisco Cordero to a one-year contract.  The 36-year-old is set to earn $4.5 million during his 14th season in the Major Leagues. To make room on its 40-man roster for Cordero, outfielder Darin Mastroianni was designated for assignment by the club.  Cordero spent last season as the full-time closer in Cincinnati but will make the transition to a setup role for Sergio Santos with the Blue Jays. It's a role he has done before, and one the veteran right-hander says will be embraced. Gregor Chisholm is a reporter for MLB.com.
