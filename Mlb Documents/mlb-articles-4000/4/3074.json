    "body": "HOUSTON -- Craig Biggio has been associated with the Astros for about half of the franchise's 50-year existence, which made him the perfect man for new general manager Jeff Luhnow to spend some time with in an effort to get a better understanding of the city and the organization.  Biggio and Luhnow talked shop for about two hours while at breakfast Wednesday morning, discussing all aspects of the organization and the future of the franchise over a few eggs, some strips of bacon and a couple of cups of coffee. But the special of the day was baseball.  Biggio, who ended his 20-year Astros career in 2007 with a club-record 3,060 hits, left the meeting convinced the future of the Astros is in good hands under the fresh leadership of owner Jim Crane, president and CEO George Postolos and Luhnow, who's been on the job for a month. \"You've got to understand, I've got 25 years here, so there's a lot of things with this organization that you understand you know,\" Biggio said. \"We're just trying to get better. At the end of the day, that's what it's all about. It's all about making the organization better and getting us back to our winning ways we were accustomed to for such a long period of time.\"   Biggio, in his fourth year as head baseball coach at St. Thomas High School in Houston, wasted little time in reaching out to Luhnow upon his arrival in the organization and had been trying to get him to attend a Houston Texans game. Their busy schedules got in the way.   \"He was new coming into town, and I'm sure that there was a lot of questions and things he had, so I just tried to go to a game one day with him and we couldn't work that out,\" Biggio said. \"I got back into town and we had breakfast, and it was great. I'm excited for our organization. He's going to do some great things. That's all that was. Just to get together and if he had any questions, I was more than happy to help him.\"   Being able to spend your entire career in one uniform like Biggio did in Houston is rare these says, though he understands why the Astros had to make difficult decisions the last couple of years in trading Roy Oswalt, Lance Berkman, Michael Bourn and Hunter Pence for prospects.   \"The situation that we're in, it's the way that we have to do things and the way we're going to do it,\" said Biggio, who has served as a special adviser to the GM since his playing days ended. \"The Minor League system is a lot better now than it was at the beginning of the year, no doubt. A lot of work has been done. We have to start getting competitive on the field first at all levels.\"   In many ways, what the Astros are going through now is similar to what Biggio had to endure early in his career.   The 20 rookies used by the Astros last year tied the 1991 team for the second-highest total in club history. In addition to Biggio and National League Rookie of the Year Jeff Bagwell, the '91 Astros featured young players Ken Caminiti, Steve Finley, Luis Gonzalez, Darryl Kile and Curt Schilling. Houston went 65-97.   With Biggio and Bagwell as the nucleus of the club, the Astros made the playoffs six times in a nine-year span from 1997-2005, including the team's only World Series berth in '05. It's been tough sledding for Houston baseball fans since, with the club suffering a club-record 106 losses last year while rebuilding.   \"There's a lot of work to be done,\" Biggio said. \"We're kind of rebuilding, getting a fresh start. If you go back to 1991, which was Jeff's rookie year, we had lots of rookies. You have to start somewhere. That's the situation we're in right now and it's going to take us some time, but we're going to get it right. We're going to get back to our winning ways. The fans here are tremendous and we need to get them excited.\"   Biggio took note of how much brain power the Astros have added to the organization since Postolos (a Harvard graduate) and Luhnow (Penn) took over.   Earlier this week, Luhnow announced the hiring of Sig Mejdal as director of decisions sciences. He has two engineering degrees at the University of California at Davis and later completed advanced degrees in operations research and cognitive psychology\/human factors. They also hired Stephanie Wilka as coordinator of amateur scouting. She has an undergraduate degree from Harvard and a law degree from Pepperdine.   \"The key ingredient to getting back to being successful is surrounding yourself with good, honest people,\" Biggio said. \"You need to have integrity and people with the skills to build this thing and get it right. We're definitely on the right path with the management team they've put together.\"   Biggio hadn't met Crane prior to his purchase of the team, and the two have talked about a half-dozen times since. Biggio said he's eager to get to know both Crane and Postolos better while staying involved as much as he can.   \"We're in a new chapter for Houston Astros baseball, and I'm excited about the direction we're going,\" he said.
