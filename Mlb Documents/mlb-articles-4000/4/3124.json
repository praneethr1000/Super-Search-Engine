    "body": "ST. LOUIS -- The Cardinals have filled their most pressing vacancy, and it has nothing to do with the active roster or the field staff.  St. Louis will name Dan Kantrovitz, currently in the Oakland Athletics' front office, as its new director of amateur scouting. Kantrovitz fills the void created when Jeff Luhnow departed to become Houston Astros general manager.  The St. Louis Post-Dispatch first reported Kantrovitz's hiring in a Wednesday story. A baseball source confirmed the move to MLB.com on Wednesday evening. The club has not announced the move, and neither Kantrovitz nor Cardinals general manager John Mozeliak could be reached for comment on Wednesday. The A's promoted Sam Geaney to the position of coordinator of international scouting. He previously served as a coordinator in the scouting department, a scouting assistant and video coordinator.
