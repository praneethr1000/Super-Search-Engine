    "body": "As the 2011 regular season wound down, immense attention was focused on Dodgers outfielder Matt Kemp's chances of winning the National League Triple Crown -- one of the dinosaurs of baseball achievements.  It is still extinct.  Kemp did lead the league with 39 home runs and 126 RBIs, but got only the bronze medal in batting with a .324 average. That preserved the Cardinals' Joe Medwick as the last man to win an NL Triple Crown -- 75 years ago. Tom Singer is a national reporter for MLB.com. Follow @Tom_Singer on Twitter.
