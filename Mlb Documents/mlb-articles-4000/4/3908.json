    "body": "We've seen the National League hold an edge on the American in recent years, what with the NL claiming three of the past four World Series crowns as well as the past two All-Star Games. But if Hot Stove happenings have any impact on the swing of the pendulum, then one can't ignore the manifest migration of star talent to the American League this winter. Albert Pujols and Prince Fielder both jumped ship for sizable sums -- the third- and fourth-most lucrative contracts in Major League history, to be exact. That Prince and Pujols have taken their talents to the AL ought to come as no surprise, as it simply makes more sense for an AL team housing the designated hitter dynamic to invest more than $200 million into a slugger who will be in his mid- to late-30s by the end of the contract than it does for an NL team to make a similar investment.
