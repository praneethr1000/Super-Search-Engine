    "body": "LOS ANGELES -- It is 2012 and high time that the National Baseball Hall of Fame recognizes scouts in some shape or form.  They are Major League Baseball's forgotten class, the guys in the trenches who dig out the talent. Unrecognized and underpaid, they've long traveled dusty roads to watch a high school kid play and squinted until their eyes turned sore from reading statistics on a laptop screen.  \"Yes, absolutely,\" said Jerry Reinsdorf, the White Sox chairman. \"Announcers and writers are recognized. We should find some way of recognizing scouts, too.\" Barry M. Bloom a> is national reporter for MLB.com and writes an MLBlog, Boomskie on Baseball. Follow @boomskie on Twitter.
