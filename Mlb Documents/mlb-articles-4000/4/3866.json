    "body": "BRADENTON, Fla. -- As Chris Duffy stood in the small clubhouse at Pirate City earlier this week, he finally smiled again. That smile carried on as he went onto the field for conditioning drills -- he ran with a grin, laughed with his teammates.  For Duffy, that smile has been a long time coming.  Why the smile now? Why the smile when his rehabilitation process still isn't over? Why the smile when his chances at making the Opening Day roster seem slim? Where did this new relaxation come from? Duffy's answer was simple: \"Now I can see the light at the end of the tunnel.\"   Though Duffy's shoulder still isn't to the point where he can do baseball-related activities, he can feel it getting there. It's the first time that the 27-year-old center fielder has been able to say that in over two years. That's reason to smile.   \"The last two years, it's been what am I going to find [out] this year,\" said Duffy, the organization's eighth-round pick in the 2001 First-Year Player Draft. \"Now I'm not in the pain I used to be in.\"   It has been just over four months since Duffy had surgery performed on his left shoulder. That surgery came just as he had finished rehabilitating his left ankle, which he severely sprained on June 27.   Duffy's shoulder pain didn't come out of nowhere last summer. He had been bothered by it since the middle of the 2005 season but had forgone surgery in favor of cortisone shots and adjustments in his throwing motion -- that is, until it became too much.   \"I would dread making throws from the outfield,\" Duffy said. \"It would get to the point where [the shoulder] would hurt so bad. I was getting numerous cortisone shots and it just got to the point where playing like that was too tough.\"   As a result, he ended his comeback attempt prematurely in order to take care of the pain once and for all. Since then, however, his health isn't the only obstacle Duffy has to overcome anymore.   While Duffy spent the final half of last season working through these injury problems, back in Pittsburgh, two center fielders -- Nate McLouth and Nyjer Morgan -- made their claim to permanently knocking Duffy out of the center-field spot moving forward.   Because Duffy has battled injury problems since making the big league roster for the first time three seasons ago, many have wondered if the center fielder will actually ever live up to the hype. Duffy admits that those concerns are justified.   \"I should be the forgotten guy. I earned it,\" he said. \"I haven't been able to prove anything. It's tough to swallow sometimes, but you can't change your past.\"   In order to peel off that stigma, Duffy took the initiative this offseason to put in more strength and conditioning work than in past years. As soon as he was cleared to begin running again in October, he started. He plans to return to the weight room to lift weights as soon as his shoulder is strong enough to handle it.   Currently, Duffy says that he has 100 percent of his flexibility back and about 75 percent of his strength back.   \"There are a couple of areas that are still tender,\" said Duffy, who hit just .249 in 70 games last season. \"We'll iron those out. Dr. [Lewis] Yocum did my surgery and he has a protocol for me. I really want to stick with that because I only want to do it once.\"   Though Duffy was one of 21 participants at this week's minicamp, he was limited to conditioning exercises only. And because the team still doesn't know how long it will be until Duffy is cleared to begin throwing and hitting again, he will begin Spring Training with certain restrictions.   \"The medical people believe that if everything goes as planned, he will be good to go on Opening Day,\" general manager Neal Huntington said. \"He won't be a guy who will be full go by the beginning of Spring Training. He is just starting his return to throwing, his return to hitting progression.\"   For Duffy, the climb to once again be named the team's starting center fielder seems to be a steep one in an organization that all of a sudden has significant depth at the position. Not only will he behind in starting spring drills, but he will have to beat out Morgan and McLouth for the position.   \"It's kind of a good thing for me,\" Duffy said of having significant competition for the starting center field spot. \"I've had to compete my entire career. I like all the guys, but I'm kind of taking it personal in worrying about myself for a while until they pick the team and then you become a team player. My play will dictate their decision.\"   Realistically, Duffy will likely start the season in Triple-A, where he can make up for lost time in Spring Training and work his way back to playing pain-free every day.   From there, however, Duffy is ready to make the most of a chance to prove that when healthy, he can still be an asset for this team.  Jenifer Langosch is a reporter for MLB.com.
