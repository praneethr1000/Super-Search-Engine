    "body": "PHILADELPHIA -- One down, three to go. The Phillies avoided salary arbitration with right-hander Kyle Kendrick on Friday, when they reached an agreement on a one-year, $3.585 million contract. The Phils have three players still eligible for salary arbitration: left-hander Cole Hamels, right fielder Hunter Pence and infielder Wilson Valdez. Kendrick, 27, proved to be a valuable piece to the staff last season, moving back and forth from the bullpen to the rotation because of injuries to Roy Oswalt and Joe Blanton. Kendrick went 8-6 with a career-best 3.22 ERA in 34 games (15 starts).  Next up are Hamels, Pence and Valdez.  Hamels is getting most of the attention, and understandably so. He can become a free agent following the 2012 season, and so far, there are no indications am extension is near.  Philadelphia general manager Ruben Amaro Jr. said while the club is looking for the value on a one-year deal for Hamels to avoid arbitration, it is does not mean it cannot or will not sign the lefty to a multiyear extension.  It just might take some time. Todd Zolecki is a reporter for MLB.com. This story was not subject to the approval of Major League Baseball or its clubs.",
