    "body": "Pat Burrell is retiring after a 12-year Major League career, according to multiple reports that surfaced on Monday afternoon.  Tim Dierkes of MLB Trade Rumors first reported that the 35-year-old outfielder was hanging up his cleats, and Ken Rosenthal of MLB Network and FOXSports.com confirmed the report on his Twitter account.  Burrell spent the bulk of his career with the Phillies, winning a World Series in 2008, then most recently with the Giants, where he got his second World Series ring in 2010. He experienced a renaissance of sorts that season after the Rays released him after 24 games. Burrell signed on with the Giants and batted .266 with 18 homers and 51 RBIs in 341 plate appearances.   Burrell played in 92 games in 2011, batting .230 with 21 RBIs and seven home runs. The No. 1 overall pick in the 1998 First-Year Player Draft, he hit 20 or more homers nine times, finishing his career with 292 home runs. Joey Nowak is a reporter for MLB.com.
