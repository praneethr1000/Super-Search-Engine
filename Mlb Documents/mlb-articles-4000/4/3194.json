    "body": "ST. LOUIS -- Lance Berkman did his best to put to rest concerns about his knees last spring, insisting that playing in the outfield would provide less wear and tear on his legs than he would have experienced playing first. Now back at first base, Berkman is changing course. \"Yeah, I was just joking with y'all,\" Berkman said on Sunday. \"It's just different. The outfield, you have more straight-line running. First base, there is a lot more lateral stops and starts, side-to-side, that kind of thing, a little more agility involved there. The wear and tear, it's probably not going to be a lot worse.\" Berkman, who underwent left knee surgery in 2010, had no issues with his knees while playing 145 games for St. Louis last season. Despite the position switch, Berkman said that his offseason training remains similar to the regimen he implemented last winter.  \"I think as you age, you learn that you have to be a little bit more conscious of how you prepare for the season,\" Berkman said. \"I learned a lot about that last year. You have to balance it. You have to listen to your body and what it's telling you. I'll be ready to go when we open camp.\"",
