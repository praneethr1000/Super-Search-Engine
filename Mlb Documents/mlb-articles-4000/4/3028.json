    "body": "ARLINGTON -- The Rangers' need for left-handed relief could open up a spot for top Minor League prospects Robbie Ross and Martin Perez this spring. General manager Jon Daniels acknowledged that it's something the Rangers could consider in Spring Training. \"Both Ross and Perez are going to work as starters, but you never know,\" Daniels said. \"We have people who believe they can start long term, but as we've seen, we've had success with guys getting experience in the bullpen and moving to the rotation. They are going to work as starters, but if that's where we have the biggest need, we'll look at it.\"  Perez (No. 2) and Ross (No. 7) are among the Rangers' top 10 prospects, according to MLB.com. Perez is ranked eighth overall. Right now, Michael Kirkman is the only reliever on the 40-man roster with Major League experience. Miguel De Los Santos, who was 5-0 with a 3.26 ERA in the Arizona Fall League, is another relief candidate.",
