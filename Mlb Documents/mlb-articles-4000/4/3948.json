    "body": "ARLINGTON -- Rangers manager Ron Washington, after leading his team to a second straight American League pennant and a club record 96 wins, has been rewarded with a two-year contract extension.  Washington, who is entering his sixth season as the Rangers manager, is now signed through 2014. The only AL manager with more job security than Washington is Mike Scioscia, who is signed with the Angels through 2018.  \"It's a very happy day for all the Rangers,\" general manager Jon Daniels said. \"You can't find a manager more beloved in the community and the organization than Ron. He has been a huge part of our success.\" Washington was hired by Daniels after the 2006 season and is now the third-longest-tenured manager in Rangers history with 810 games. He trails Bobby Valentine, who managed the Rangers for 1,186 games from 1985-92, and Johnny Oates, who managed them for 983 games in 1995-2001.            T.R. Sullivan is a reporter for MLB.com.
