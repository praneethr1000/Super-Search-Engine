    "body": "The Rangers met on Friday with free-agent first baseman Prince Fielder at a Dallas-area hotel, according to multiple media reports.  Fielder is the highest-profile free agent remaining on the market. The Nationals also are believed to be heavily involved with Fielder, who, according to reports, is seeking a long-term deal with a no-trade clause. The Mariners have also been connected with Fielder. Bob Nightengale of USA Today first reported the meeting on Friday afternoon via Twitter. Jeff Wilson of the Fort Worth Star-Telegram, citing a source, reported on Friday via Twitter that the Rangers' interest in Fielder is more of a fallback option in case they can't sign Japanese pitching sensation Yu Darvish. The Rangers, who submitted the winning bid to negotiate with Darvish, have a deadline of Wednesday afternoon to sign the right-hander to a contract. Thomas Harding is a reporter for MLB.com.
