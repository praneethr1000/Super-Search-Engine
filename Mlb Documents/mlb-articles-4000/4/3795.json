    "body": "ARLINGTON -- The Rangers could have a deal finalized with free agent reliever Eddie Guardado by the end of the week, his agent said Tuesday.  \"There are just a few things we need to work out,\" Kevin Kohler said by phone. \"I feel comfortable that we'll be able to get it done and have something worked out by the end of the week.\"  Guardado, 37, is a left-hander with 15 years in the big leagues and 183 career saves who is expected to compete with C.J. Wilson, Joaquin Benoit and possibly Kazuo Fukumori for the closer's job. Two other Hall of Famers did wear Rangers uniform. Ted Williams was their first manager and one of his coaches was Hall of Fame second baseman Nelson Fox.    Also attending are Vice-President Jim Sundberg, broadcaster Victor Rojas and former Rangers Mickey Tettleton and RedHawks longtime skipper, Bobby Jones.       Briefly:  In addition to Guardado, the Rangers are expected to officially add Fukumori to the 40-man roster this week. That will require them to make two roster moves to take two players off. ... Manager Ron Washington and general manager Jon Daniels are scheduled to be in Lafayette La., on Thursday as guests of Rangers scout Mel Didier for a banquet benefiting the Louisiana Housing Authority.
