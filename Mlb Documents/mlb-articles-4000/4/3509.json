    "body": "MILWAUKEE -- The Brewers and reliever Francisco Rodriguez agreed to a one-year, $8 million contract just ahead of Tuesday's deadline for arbitration-eligible players and their teams to exchange figures.  The team also struck a $2.175 million deal with reliever Kameron Loe, leaving only two arbitration-eligible players unsigned: starter Shaun Marcum and reliever Jose Veras.  Rodriguez was the team's trickiest case because he was a free agent who accepted arbitration, not a player with the usual three to six years of Major League service, and because he is a career closer who is serving as a setup man with the Brewers. Those factors could have made for an interesting debate between the Brewers and agent Scott Boras about Rodriguez's value in the current market. According to The Associated Press, Marcum requested $8.7 million in arbitration and the Brewers offered $6.75 million. Marcum earned $4.05 million last season and was Milwaukee's most reliable starting pitcher before a late-season swoon. The right-hander is entering his final season before free agency, but the sides have discussed only a one-year agreement.   Veras, acquired in December from the Pirates for third baseman Casey McGehee, filed for $2.375 million and the Brewers offered $2 million, according to the AP. McGehee, incidentally, filed for $2.725 million and the Pirates offered $2.35 million. Adam McCalvy is a reporter for MLB.com. Read his blog, Brew Beat, and follow him on Twitter at @AdamMcCalvy.
