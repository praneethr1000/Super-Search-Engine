Pentland, 65, spent the past four years in the Dodgers organization, including the past two seasons as their Major League hitting coach. The prior two years he was the Dodgers' Minor League hitting instructor.  Pentland has 13 years of experience as a Major League hitting coach, including with the Mariners from 2005-08. He also worked in that capacity with the Royals (2002-05) and Cubs (1997-2002). Pentland has been in professional baseball for 22 years, having also worked with the Mets and Marlins as a scout and Minor League hitting coach.   Pentland played baseball at Arizona State and helped the Sun Devils win the national championship in 1967 before playing Minor League ball with the Padres from 1969-71. He was inducted into the ASU Hall of Fame in 2002.   Pentland will replace Alonzo Powell, who was hired recently by the Padres to become their second Major League hitting coach.
