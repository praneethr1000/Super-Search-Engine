    "body": "BOSTON -- Tim Bogar not only survived the transition from Terry Francona to Bobby Valentine, but he got a promotion out of it.  In other words, the Red Sox think highly of Bogar for his baseball knowledge and his interpersonal skills, both of which will be tapped into more in his new position. By going from third-base coach to bench coach, Bogar has a unique dynamic in which he will take on more responsibility but less scrutiny.  Aside from actually managing the local nine, there are very few summer jobs in the Boston area in which you can endure more criticism than coaching third base for the Red Sox. Rene Lachemann, Wendell Kim, Dale Sveum and Bogar all found out how harsh public favor could be when a Boston baserunner had the indecency to get thrown out at the plate. Bogar can laugh about it now because he's on the other side of it.   \"Honestly, it was a great experience,\" said Bogar, who coached third for the Red Sox the past two years. \"I honestly enjoyed it. Obviously, it's a very scrutinized position in Boston. But to be honest with you, it taught me even a lot more about the game and how to visualize it, and I wouldn't trade it for anything. Coaching third base in Boston, I've been told by many, many people, it's the hardest place to coach third base in all of baseball.\"   Fenway not only has challenging dimensions for a base coach -- quirky outfield gaps and corners, and even a ladder that can cause weird clangs off the Green Monster -- but a rabid fan base that keeps score of the success rate of baserunners trying to score.   Now, Bogar will shift out of the public eye and become one of Valentine's most important coaches.   At the age of 45, perhaps it also puts Bogar on the fast track to reach his ultimate goal of managing in the Majors. That is often the next climb on the rung for a bench coach.   \"You know what, I honestly do [want to manage],\" Bogar said. \"I take it one step at a time, and this is the next challenge for me. It's very eye-opening for me in the fact that I'm more involved with the manager than I was when Tito was here, because of my role. Secondly, [I'm] dealing with the front office a little bit more. I think it does nothing but prepare you for a future role. Ultimately, would I like to manage? Of course. We'll see what happens in the course of this season and seasons to come, if I'm prepared and I do the job I'm supposed to do as a bench coach.\"   When the season starts, it might feel a little strange for Bogar to stay seated when the Red Sox come up to bat.   \"It's going to be a different thing, where when you're coaching third base, you feel like you're playing every night, because you have a direct impact on the game,\" Bogar said. \"The whole thought process is a little bit different, because you have to see the game basically as a manager. Hopefully I'll have the answers that Bobby looks for when he's asking, and you have to see the game in a whole different way.   \"That part of it is really exciting to me, because it's something I've always enjoyed doing and it's something I feel like I can put my mind around that very well. So far, Bobby and I, we get along very well. Our thought process is a lot alike. I think it's going to be fun to be in there with him and see how he goes about things.\"   Bogar proved his ability to manage in four seasons split between the Indians' and Astros' farm systems from 2004-07. He advanced to the postseason three times.   When Robin Ventura (White Sox) and Mike Matheny (Cardinals) were both hired this winter without a day of managing experience at any level, Bogar had no ill feelings.   \"Honestly, it is what it is,\" Bogar said. \"Organizations are going to hire the person they feel is best for the job. A lot of times nowadays, it has to do with the history of the organization, and from what I know of Robin and what I know of Mike Matheny, they are both unbelievable baseball people. They understand the game. They understand how to communicate with people.   \"The bottom line is that I never worry about anybody else getting hired or me not getting hired or anything like that. I'm actually happy for both of those teams, and hopefully a situation like that will happen for myself and even DeMarlo [Hale] and guys like that. You just have to be put in the right situation, and both those guys obviously were.\"   When it comes to a stepping-stone position, Bogar thinks this one is ideal. He will work for a manager he played for late in the 1996 season, the same manager who helped relay the information that he had been traded to the Astros in Spring Training of '97.   \"How it all went down when I got traded to Houston, there wasn't as much of a need for me on the [Mets] team that year,\" Bogar said. \"They decided to go a different direction. They actually started to put me on waivers. I don't know if Houston claimed me or not, but I was traded for Luis Lopez. Well, Bobby and I have actually talked about it, and it was actually a really good thing for me. I enjoyed my four years in Houston and I got to play a lot more, and I actually went further with my career in Houston than I ever would have in New York. There's always a reason for something.\"   After working under Francona the past three years, Bogar will now have access to another manager with an impressive pedigree.   \"I'm always trying to personally get better and look at things in different ways, and Bobby is very good at doing that,\" Bogar said. \"It's going to be a really good thing for me personally to be with him as his right-hand man.\"   Bogar will also take on a bigger role in the clubhouse, as the bench coach is the one who often has a lot of conversations with the players informing them about lineup decisions and other things along those lines. There is already a foundation for a lot of those relationships, given Bogar's previous role with the team.   \"I think the relationships will just get stronger and we'll get closer,\" Bogar said. \"Obviously, I feel close to a lot of these guys, but I also feel like I can be closer. Being a bench coach, I'll be interacting with everybody a little bit more on a personal level. I'm looking forward to that, too, because we have a bunch of great guys on this team. As much as people want to think contrary to it, this is a great group of guys that works really hard and they're ready to do some really, really good things. I'm just glad I'm going to get to be a part of it and get to know them that well as we go through it together.\"   Yes, the dynamic of Boston's clubhouse will be of interest this season, given all the stories that came out after the 2011 season. Bogar doesn't seem to buy the idea that a lack of chemistry or professionalism had much to do with the team's epic collapse. But he hopes he can make a difference.   \"When you look at last year, everybody has to find something or some reason why it went wrong,\" Bogar said. \"The focus was turned to the clubhouse, and that was the reason why. To a man in there, I don't think anybody is going to put their finger on one thing and say, 'This is the reason why we lost.' Being able to be part of that clubhouse now as the bench coach, you know, obviously, you get to put a little bit of your personality into it, and hopefully some of the things that I can say and do are going to come across in a positive way and motivate these guys to play even better than they have in the past.\"   As the calendar inches toward February, Bogar's main task is to map out a daily schedule for Spring Training. He will find out what Valentine needs and make sure it is executed. This isn't unfamiliar for Bogar considering he did the same thing for Joe Maddon in 2008, when he was the quality assurance coach for the Tampa Bay Rays.   \"Obviously, we'll do everything Bobby needs to get done and what he needs to focus on, and that's going to be just baseball in general and playing the game the way it's supposed to be played,\" Bogar said. \"There's no point that's more important than the next. As we put the schedule together, it's going to be a situation where whatever he needs, we're going to do.\"   Bogar will feel a little more confident about his schedule once he gets down to Florida with Valentine to get a full picture of Jet Blue Park, Boston's new state-of-the-art Spring Training facility.   \"There will be a couple of days of trying to figure that out before camp actually starts,\" said Bogar. \"I think we're all looking forward to starting at a new place this year and getting it all right. There's nothing like preparing for Fenway on a Fenway-looking field. We know what we need to do. We're going to a new place in Florida. We'll start fresh. I think it's going to be good for everybody.\" Ian Browne is a reporter for MLB.com. Read his blog, Brownie Points, and follow him on Twitter @IanMBrowne.
