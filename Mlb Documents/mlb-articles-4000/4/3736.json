    "body": "ARLINGTON -- The Rangers expect to sign Japanese pitcher Yu Darvish before Wednesday's 4 p.m. CT deadline.  Club sources said Texas doesn't have a deal done yet, and it could go down to the last day. But sources said the Rangers expect negotiations to get done if everybody stays \"fair and reasonable.\"  If the Rangers get Darvish's deal done as expected, they are not expecting to sign free-agent first baseman Prince Fielder. The Rangers met with Fielder and his agent Scott Boras on Friday in Dallas in what was described as a \"preliminary meeting.\" T.R. Sullivan is a reporter for MLB.com.
