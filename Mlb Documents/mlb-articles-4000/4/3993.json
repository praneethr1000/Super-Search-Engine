    "body": "MILWAUKEE -- Brewers ace Zack Greinke said he is still operating without an agent, but that does not necessarily scuttle the chances of a contract extension.  Greinke is entering his second season with the team, and the final season of the four-year, $38 million extension he signed in January 2009. He severed his ties with CAA Sports last year, after the Brewers acquired Greinke in a trade with the Royals.  \"It'd be me in charge as of right now,\" he said. \"So, we'll see how long that lasts.\" Adam McCalvy is a reporter for MLB.com.
