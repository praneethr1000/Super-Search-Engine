    "body": "PARADISE VALLEY, Ariz. -- There was no movement regarding a possible A's relocation from Oakland to San Jose on Wednesday, the first day of the Owners Meetings, despite a flurry of discussions. But the A's may shift their Spring Training venue from Phoenix to Mesa, Ariz., in 2015, said Lew Wolff, the team's managing partner.  Wolff and A's president Mike Crowley met with Mesa City Manager Christopher Brady on Wednesday morning to discuss the possible move to HoHoKam Stadium, long the home of the Chicago Cubs. The Cubs are moving to a new facility in Mesa after the 2014 spring season.  \"We're preparing a draft lease for them and they're going to look at it,\" Wolff told reporters. \"We're going to do a lot of remodeling of the ballpark.\" Barry M.
