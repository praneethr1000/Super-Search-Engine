    "body": "ARLINGTON -- The Rangers have signed left-handed pitcher Mitch Stetter and right-hander Sean Green to Minor League contracts with invitations to Spring Training.  Stetter, 31, has pitched in 132 Major League games with the Brewers, and is 8-2 with a 4.08 ERA. He has held left-handed hitters to a .194 batting average over his career, giving him a chance to make the team as a left-handed relief specialist.  He missed most of last season with a left hip injury and pitched in just 16 games. His best season in the Major Leagues was in 2009, when he went 4-1 with a 3.60 ERA in 71 games for the Brewers. He was also 3-1 with a 3.20 ERA in 30 games for Milwaukee in '08. T.R. Sullivan is a reporter for MLB.com. Read his blog, Postcards from Elysian Fields, and follow him on Twitter @Sullivan_Ranger.
