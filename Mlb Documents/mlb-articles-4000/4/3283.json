    "body": "Justin Verlander has talked many times about his pregame routine of listening to music blaring through his headphones as he enters a ballpark on days he starts. He saved the story about his pre-gameday meal for the late-night talk-show circuit.  When host Conan O'Brien asked Verlander about his pregame rituals during Wednesday night's show, Verlander talked about his meals the night before he starts.  \"The night before, as you can tell by my amazing physique, I eat Taco Bell,\" Verlander said. \"Every night.\" He went into detail with it, describing the same order: \"Three crunchy taco supremes, no tomato, cheesy gordita crunch, and a Mexican pizza, no tomato.\"   It'll never qualify as healthy eating, athlete or not, but it served to set up his punchline.   \"You're welcome, Taco Bell,\" Verlander said as he turned to the camera.   It was a rare relief appearance for Verlander, the Tigers ace who was both the American League Most Valuable Player and Cy Young Award winner. It was also a rare venue for him to try his hand at comedy. He retold the story of his hotfoot prank on teammate Don Kelly, which they replayed.   \"The cup of water is really not enough if things get out of hand,\" O'Brien joked.   While Verlander usually begins his mound outings by throwing his fastball at less than full velocity, he came to the set firing as soon as he sat down. He told O'Brien about seeing the giant orange Conan Blimp advertising his show flying over Yankee Stadium during their AL Division Series last fall.   \"Here we are in the postseason in New York,\" Verlander begins, \"and you've got your blimp flying up there. It's supposed to be a night game, and this thing looks like the sun. It's huge!   \"That's what I had to stare at the whole game, because I'm a pitcher, so when I'm not pitching, I just sit around in the dugout and look around, because we don't really do much. So every time I look up, I see this thing, and I can't help it. I'm envisioning your face on the side of this blimp, and it's just like haunting me the whole series.\"   The show was taped in Los Angeles, where Verlander has been spending the week doing a shoot for the upcoming MLB 2K12 video game. Verlander was on Conan to promote the game, which features him on the cover pitching with special effects all around him.   \"Do you like how you're depicted on the cover? You look kind of like a superhero here,\" O'Brien asked as he showed off the cover.   \"I mean, it's me. I look great,\" Verlander said with a laugh. Jason Beck is a reporter for MLB.com.
