    "body": "ARLINGTON -- One of the Rangers' goals going into the offseason was to explore long-term contracts with some of their key players. Texas can completely focus its energy in that direction now that it has signed pitcher Yu Darvish and now that Prince Fielder is off the board.  According to published reports, the Tigers have agreed to a nine-year, $214 million contract with Fielder. Rangers officials have been saying that it was \"very unlikely\" that they would be able to sign Fielder, and that proved to be true. The Rangers were never willing to go that many years or invest that much money on Fielder.  The Rangers quietly were hoping that Fielder's asking price would drop to a point where they might be able to get involved. Instead, he reportedly has agreed to what would be the fourth largest contract in Major League history. The Rangers were told on Monday that they were out of the running. The Rangers' biggest priority right now is outfielder Josh Hamilton, who can be a free agent after this upcoming season. The club is actively working with his agent, Michael Moye, on a possible contract extension that would prevent him from leaving, but an agreement does not appear imminent.            T.R.
