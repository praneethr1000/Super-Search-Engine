    "body": "SAN FRANCISCO -- Aaron Rowand peered out of an AT&T Park luxury suite toward the left-field area where the greatest Giants of all have been immortalized. \"Look at those retired numbers,\" Rowand said. Visiting his new home ballpark for the first time since signing his five-year, $60 million contract Dec. 12, Rowand spoke freely of his appreciation for baseball's past.  \"I have a passion for the history of the game,\" the 30-year-old center fielder said Wednesday. \"If you take just half of those [defeats] and turn them into wins, you're in the playoffs,\" Rowand said. \"This team isn't far off.\"   \"I'm kind of a people person, I think, because I talk too much. So I'll be all right,\" he said.     You're not going to replace Bonds, either -- that is, Barry Bonds, the left fielder and all-time home run leader who the Giants won't re-sign after an illustrious 15-year tenure with them. Despite his career-high 27 home runs last season with Philadelphia, Rowand knows that he's not the power hitter Bonds was. Through Spring Training and the start of the regular season, Rowand's likely to draw extra attention as the Giants' primary free-agent acquisition. But he vowed not to let the fuss disrupt his focus. No matter what, Rowand will keep chasing fly balls with abandon, striving to take the extra base and running out every ground ball.  Chris Haft is a reporter for MLB.com.
