    "body": "MILWAUKEE -- Brewers manager Ron Roenicke and two of his Major League coaches will be among a club contingent watching outfielder Norichika Aoki's workout this weekend at Maryvale Baseball Park, the first step in determining whether both sides want to spend the ensuing week pursuing a deal.  Roenicke, bench coach Jerry Narron and hitting coach Johnny Narron will attend the one-day affair with Brewers general manager Doug Melvin, director of pro scouting Zack Minasian and his predecessor, Dick Groch, now a special assistant to Melvin. So will two Brewers officials who spend most of their time at Maryvale: special assistant and player development director Reid Nichols and his top assistant, Tony Diggs.  They will watch Aoki take batting practice off the coaches, they will hit him fly balls and gauge his throwing arm and they will time his running speed. Adam McCalvy is a reporter for MLB.com.
