    "body": "DENVER -- The quest to beef up Colorado's pitching staff resulted in the Rockies obtaining right-hander Guillermo Moscoso and left-hander Josh Outman from the Athletics on Monday for outfielder Seth Smith.  The Rockies' signing of free-agent outfielder Michael Cuddyer dictated that the team would seek to deal Smith. The Rockies talked with the Braves in an attempt to acquire second baseman Martin Prado but did not reach an agreement, and the Mariners also were mentioned in reports.  However, the deal with the Athletics for Moscoso, 28, who set career highs in nearly every category last season, and Outman, 27, who has been in and out of the Majors since 2008, satisfied the initiative to build pitching depth and competition. Outman's career was interrupted by an elbow surgery that required surgery in June 2009 and cost him the rest of that year and all of 2010. Outman is a fly-ball pitcher, but he has a chance for success.         Smith patiently sat through the trade speculation until the deal finally occurred.   \"I was able to talk to [Athletics general manager] Billy Beane earlier today, and he had some good things to say and some exciting things,\" Smith said. \"We're definitely looking forward to the opportunity. I'd like to say that our time in Denver was fantastic. My wife and family, we love Denver, and it'll always have a special place for us, and I have nothing but great things to say about the city, the fans and the organization. We're definitely going to miss it.\"  Thomas Harding is a reporter for MLB.com. Read his blog, Hardball in the Rockies, and follow him on Twitter @harding_at_mlb.
