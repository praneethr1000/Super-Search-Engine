    "body": "ANAHEIM -- Kendrys Morales is in Colorado this week undergoing tests for the broken left ankle that has sidelined him for the last 1 1\/2 seasons. Morales, who has had two procedures on the ankle, had been running on a weightless treadmill and hitting off a tee.  The Angels' hope is that the switch-hitting Morales can amp up those workouts if the tests come back with encouraging results.  \"It's certainly reason for being cautiously optimistic,\" general manager Jerry Dipoto said of the planned tests. \"We're as optimistic as we've been throughout the entire process with Kendrys, and I think at the end of the day, this is a moment where we can find out if he can take the next step. And that's the extent of it, really.\" ",
