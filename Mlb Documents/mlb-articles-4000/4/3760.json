    "body": "SEATTLE -- Jack Zduriencik didn't try to sugarcoat anything at Thursday's pre-Spring Training media luncheon at Safeco Field.  The Mariners general manager, entering his fourth season with the club, doesn't have a Prince Fielder or Albert Pujols to sell to his fans like the Tigers and Angels. He's not coming off back-to-back World Series appearances like the American League West-rival Rangers.  What he does have is a strong core of up-and-coming talent that might surprise people this season, but more than likely will require patience and a long-term view of the progress being made.
