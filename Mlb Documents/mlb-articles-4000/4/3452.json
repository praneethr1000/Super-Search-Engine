    "body": "SEATTLE -- Ten days after word leaked out that the Mariners and Yankees were swapping premier young talents Jesus Montero and Michael Pineda, the teams on Monday finalized what Seattle general manager Jack Zduriencik called \"an old-fashion baseball trade.\"  \"We had a need, and to get a really good player, you have to give up good players,\" Zduriencik said once the deal was announced following completion of Montero's physical exams. \"Neither one of us was trying to walk away from this thinking we got the upper hand. There were no contracts involved, it was strictly talent for talent.\"  The stunning part of the deal was the level of the talents, with Montero widely regarded as one of the premier young hitting prospects in the game and Pineda already having achieved American League All-Star status last year as a rookie.
