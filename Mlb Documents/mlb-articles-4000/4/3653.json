    "body": "NEW YORK -- The Mets announced Thursday that they have invited top prospects Matt Harvey and Matt Den Dekker to big league camp, awarding both for strong performances in 2011. Harvey, who ranked second on MLB.com's midseason Top 10 Mets prospects list and 45th in all of baseball, posted a 4.53 ERA in 12 starts for Double-A Binghamton last year. Harvey finished the season 5-0 with a 2.68 mark in his final seven starts, striking out 36 batters in 37 innings. The seventh overall Draft pick in 2010, Harvey may begin this season back in Double-A, but he figures to advance quickly, potentially cracking the big leagues by the end of this season. Den Dekker, the club's fifth-round pick in the same Draft, hit .235 with 11 home runs following a midseason promotion to Double-A. In sum, the speedy outfielder hit 17 homers and 11 triples in 139 games split between Binghamton and Class A St. Lucie, also stealing 24 bases.  The Mets did not invite top pitching prospect Zack Wheeler to big league camp. Harvey, Wheeler and Jeurys Familia are widely considered the organization's top three overall prospects.  Mets pitchers and catchers must report to Port St. Lucie, Fla., by Feb. 20, with their first workout scheduled for Feb. 22. The first full-squad workout is Feb. 27.
