    "body": "PARADISE VALLEY, Ariz. -- Major League Baseball has pre-approved a number of applicants to purchase minority shares of the Mets, sources confirmed on Wednesday.  The pre-approval process doesn't necessarily mean that those who have applied will become investors in the club, as final documents still have to be signed. Those details must be determined and eventually announced by the Mets.  The New York Daily News reported on Wednesday that the Mets were close to finalizing the sale of at least five minority shares at $20 million apiece. Last Thursday, general manager Sandy Alderson indicated that the team still expects to close on the first of multiple minority ownership sales by the end of January. Barring settlement, principal owner Fred Wilpon and partner Saul Katz are scheduled to go to trial in March with the trustee seeking to recover funds from Bernard Madoff's Ponzi scheme. The trustee, Irving Picard, is currently appealing a ruling that reduced the lawsuit's total stake from $1 billion to $386 million.  Alderson said last month that the team recently lost $70 million in 2011 through regular operations, irrespective of the lawsuit. The team has also owed Major League Baseball $25 million for more than a year and recently received a $40 million bridge loan from Bank of America to cover operating expenses. MLB Commissioner Bud Selig said twice in October that he is not concerned about the Mets' ability to repay their debts.    Barry M.
