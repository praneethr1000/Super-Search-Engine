    "body": "PHILADELPHIA -- A spot on the Phillies' roster must have looked a thousand miles away to Phillippe Aumont in 2010. It looks much, much closer just a month away from Spring Training in 2012. Aumont joined Philadelphia's organization following the infamous Cliff Lee trade in December 2009, which sent Lee to Seattle for Aumont, Tyson Gillies and J.C. Ramirez. The Phils converted Aumont from a reliever to a starter, and the club altered his pitching mechanics the following spring before he opened the season with Double-A Reading. He struggled and lost confidence, and the Phillies demoted him to Class A Clearwater as he continued to feel the seemingly endless pressures from being in the Lee deal. But after a stellar 2011 following a return to the bullpen, Aumont has a chance this year to wear red pinstripes before the end of the season.  It seems like a matter of when, not if.  \"That's going to be out of my control,\" said Aumont, who is one of 10 prospects in Philadelphia this week for the Phillies' Prospect Education Program, which consists of various seminars with front-office executives and representatives as well as former and current Philadelphia players like Jim Thome and Dan Plesac.  Aumont went 2-5 with a 2.68 ERA and averaged an impressive 13.1 strikeouts per nine innings in 43 appearances last season with Reading and Triple-A Lehigh Valley. Of course, he acknowledged he still has work to do. Aumont had some issues with his command at Lehigh Valley as his WHIP (walks plus hits per inning pitched) shot from 1.097 with Reading to 1.544.  But if Aumont continues to improve and a need arises in the Phillies' bullpen -- it's almost an impossibility every reliever on Philadelphia's Opening Day roster will make it the entire season without incident or injury -- he could put himself in position to be called up.  Mike Stutes provided Aumont with that road map last season. He impressed the Phillies last Spring Training, and when a need arose in April, Philadelphia called up Stutes.  Stutes stuck the rest of the season.  \"In 2010, I felt like I took the highway in another direction,\" Aumont said. \"But then I felt I made good progress last season. I'm getting closer to where I want to be. I still have some stuff I have to work on. Spring Training is right around the corner. Nobody knows what can happen. A good spring and a good first month in the Minor Leagues, and who knows? The decision is going to be coming from [pitching coach Rich] Dubee, [GM] Ruben [Amaro Jr.] and [manager] Charlie [Manuel]. We'll see what they think.\"  Aumont is more comfortable pitching in the bullpen, where his physical talents showed up, but he has also worked on his mental game. He has worked with Dr. Jack Curtis, who is the Phillies' mental skills coach.  It helped.  \"We got the screws tightened a little bit up there,\" Aumont said with a smile. \"I stayed positive [last season]. In 2010, I wasn't a positive person. Not because I didn't want to. But my game wasn't where I wanted it to be, so I brought myself down. I said in 2011 I want to have fun. That was one of the main things. Have fun and give it your best. Come out with a smile no matter what.\"  Aumont enters Spring Training in a great frame of mind with a good season behind him. If he keeps improving, he could have plenty of reasons to smile in 2012.
