    "body": "The Yankees announced a series of personnel changes Tuesday, including the hiring of former Cubs general manager Jim Hendry as a special assignment scout. Hendry, who had spent the last 9 1\/2 years as the Cubs' GM, was relieved of his duties in Chicago on Aug. 19. This will mark the first season that Hendry has not been a member of the Cubs organization since 1994. The 56-year-old started as the club's director of player development in November 1994 before taking over as scouting director prior to the 1996 season. Two years later, Hendry became the director of player development and scouting, and he was then named the team's assistant general manager in August 2000. In 2002, Hendry assumed his role as the general manager until his dismissal last season. Prior to his stint in Chicago, Hendry notched three years of experience with the Florida Marlins, working as a scout, Minor League manager and a special assistant to then-GM Dave Dombrowski.  Along with the hiring of Hendry, the Yankees also named Steve Donohue their head athletic trainer and Mark Littlefield as assistant athletic trainer. Other promotions within the baseball operations department included moving Jean Afterman to senior vice president\/assistant general manager, Billy Eppler to assistant general manager and Will Kuntz to manager of pro scouting.
