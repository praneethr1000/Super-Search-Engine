    "body": "ARLINGTON -- Rangers officials said Sunday they do not have an agreement with free-agent third baseman Adrian Beltre. There appears to be some mutual interest on both sides, but nothing is remotely imminent. A report out of the Dominican Republic said the Rangers had reached an agreement on a six-year, $96 million contract with Beltre. Club officials said the only agreements that the Rangers have are with free-agent pitchers Brandon Webb and Arthur Rhodes.  The Rangers reached an agreement with Rhodes three days before Christmas and one with Webb the day after. Neither agreement has been announced. Both pitchers were supposed to undergo physicals and the Rangers still have not made room on their 40-man roster. Right now, they have a full 40-man roster. Here's a look at Sunday's other news from around the league:   The Phillies haven't started negotiating a multiyear deal with 2008 World Series MVP Cole Hamels, the Philadelphia Inquirer reported Sunday. Hamels' current contract will expire after next season but he won't be eligible for free agency until after the 2012 season.   After the Orioles added Derrek Lee, it became unlikely that they'd add another full-time designated hitter, MASN.com reported Sunday. With Lee and Luke Scott on the roster, there doesn't seem to be a possible fit for a player like Vladimir Guerrero or Jim Thome.   The White Sox may be interested in adding Rafael Soriano to the back end of their bullpen, but a big offseason has likely left them without enough cash to add the right-hander, SI.com's Jon Heyman reported on Twitter late Saturday night.
