But that title may now be shifting to another club -- the Mets.  The Minneapolis Star-Tribune reported Thursday that the Twins are interested in a package the Mets have offered. It includes top pitching prospect Deolis Guerra, outfielder Carlos Gomez and pitchers Kevin Mulvey and Phil Humber. Kelly Thesier is a reporter for MLB.com.
