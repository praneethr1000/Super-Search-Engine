    "body": "CINCINNATI -- Reds great shortstop Barry Larkin learned he was elected to the Hall of Fame at his house in Orlando, Fla., on Monday. He was feted during a Tuesday news conference in New York.  Wednesday was all about Larkin's hometown of Cincinnati and enjoying the moment with his family. The 47-year-old was part of a press conference at Great American Ball Park while flanked by his wife, Lisa, his parents Shirley and Robert, and two of his four siblings -- Byron and Stephen.  \"These last two days have been an absolute blur,\" Larkin said. \"Strategically, Lisa and I decided that today was going to be the day that we came to Cincinnati. All the other stuff, we got out of the way. We could take a deep breath. We could come to Cincinnati and set up how we're going to celebrate this induction with the city of Cincinnati. And that's important. I'm really looking forward to that day. Larkin also said he is making plans of his own celebration with fans of Cincinnati, but has yet to get specific.
