    "body": "NEW YORK -- Major League Baseball unilaterally implemented on Monday changes in clubhouse security recommended in last month's much-awaited report by former Sen. George Mitchell.  Thirteen of Mitchell's 19 recommendations involve security and education and don't have to be collectively bargained with the Players Association. The other six involve the regulation and implementation of the testing program, items currently under negotiation with the union.  Commissioner Bud Selig, who said on Dec. 13, the day the Report was released, that he would \"embrace\" all of the recommendations, tightened security in clubhouses, where Mitchell reported that personal trainers, clubhouse personnel and even players were illegally trafficking in performance-enhancing substances.
