    "body": "There's no discounting the importance of a strong farm system feeding into Miami. These may be the Minor Leagues, but for the Marlins, there's nothing minor about them. And so the men in charge hold an important place within the organization. The Marlins announced who would lead their farm teams on Friday, finalizing each Minor League on-field staff for the upcoming season. There were no surprises up top, as Dean Treanor will return to manage Triple-A Albuquerque for his sixth season. In 2007, he guided the Isotopes to within two games of the playoffs in the Pacific Coast League, ultimately settling for second place in the American South division. Treanor will be joined in Albuquerque by pitching coach Richard Gale, hitting coach Steven Phillips and trainer Steven Miller.  At Double-A Carolina, the Mudcats will look to new manager Matt Raleigh to guide some of their most promising prospects. Raleigh, who was a former Marlins Minor League hitting coach, is back for his 15th season in professional baseball after straying away from the business for two years.  His task won't be an easy one, as the Mudcats finished in the bottom half of the Southern League a year ago. But he'll be managing the future. Last season, Daniel Barone, Rick VandenHurk and Chris Seddon all pitched significant innings at Carolina -- and all became Marlins starters before the summer was through.  Raleigh's staff at Carolina includes pitching coach Scott Mitchell, hitting coach Theron Todd and trainer Ben Heimos.  Last year's Mudcats manager, Brandon Hyde, will jump down a level to manage Class A Jupiter. There, he'll join pitching coach Reid Cornelius and hitting coach Anthony Iapoce, with a trainer yet to be determined.  At Class A Greensboro of the South Atlantic League, Edwin Rodriguez will return for a second season after finishing in the middle of the standings a year ago. He'll work with pitching coach John Duffy, hitting coach Jorge Hernandez and trainer James Stone.  Darin Everson will also return for a second season at Class A Jamestown, after making his managerial debut last year with the short-season Jammers. Pitching coach Charlie Corbell Jr. and hitting coach Johnny Rodriguez are both back for another year, along with new trainer Julio Hernandez.  And the Gulf Coast League Marlins will be led by manager Steve Watson, pitching coach Jeff Schwartz, hitting coach Andy Haines and trainer Cesar Roman.  Helping run the whole operation are the Minor League field coordinators, a group that's largely unchanged from last season. John Pierson is back as field coordinator, Wayne Rosenthal is again the pitching coordinator and John Mallee will return as the hitting coordinator. Rounding out the group are infield coordinator Josue Espada, outfield and baserunning coordinator Tarrik Brock, catching coordinator Tim Cossins, rehab and training coordinator Gene Basham and strength and conditioning coordinator Josh Seligman.
