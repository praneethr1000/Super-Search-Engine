    "body": "MINNEAPOLIS -- One of the primary goals for the Twins last offseason was to lock up first baseman Justin Morneau to a long-term deal.

But so far it appears no progress has been made on that front. Kelly Thesier is a reporter for MLB.com. This story was not subject to the approval of Major League Baseball or its clubs.",
