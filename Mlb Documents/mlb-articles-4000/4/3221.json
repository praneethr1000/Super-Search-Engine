    "body": "ARLINGTON -- First baseman Mitch Moreland said on Saturday that offseason surgery on his right wrist went well, and he is on schedule to participate in all baseball activities when Spring Training starts in five weeks. Moreland said he will begin hitting off a tee next week. His wrist is healing ahead of schedule.  \"The only thing I'm behind on is I usually start my workouts earlier than this,\" Moreland said. Moreland played through the wrist pain going back to early June, he said. He was willing to do so with the Rangers getting back to the World Series again. \"I wanted to play,\" Moreland said. \"I did the best I could to help the team win.\"  Moreland said Saturday that he is aware that the Rangers had \"preliminary talks\" with Prince Fielder and his agent Scott Boras on Friday in Dallas, but that he's not worried about it.  \"It's the business side of it,\" Moreland said. \"He's a great player, and he can hit. All I can do is worry about getting healthy and being a part of this team, and helping them win and getting back to where we were last year.\"  Moreland has been told he will strictly play first base this season, after playing some right field two seasons ago.",
