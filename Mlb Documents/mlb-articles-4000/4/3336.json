    "body": "LOS ANGELES -- Dodgers third-base coach Tim Wallach and his family will receive the Ray Boone Family Award at Saturday's Professional Baseball Scouts Foundation banquet at the Hyatt Regency Century Plaza Hotel.  Wallach developed into an All-Star third baseman, retired and went into developing players as a Minor League coach and manager, and even launched a home-grown farm system, producing with wife Lori three sons drafted by the Dodgers.  Matt, at 25 the eldest and a 22nd-round pick in 2007, has healed from a broken finger suffered in a plate collision last year at Double-A Chattanooga and was one of 15 top prospects who participated in this week's Winter Development Minicamp. Middle son Brett, a 23-year-old pitcher taken in the third round of 2009, was traded by the Dodgers to the Cubs in the Ted Lilly deal in 2010 and is coming off a season of adjustment.   Youngest son Chad, a 20-year-old infielder drafted in the 43rd round of 2010, didn't sign and is the catcher at Cal State Fullerton, the alma mater of Tim and Brett.   \"I always hoped my kids would want to play, but the game is so tough,\" Tim said. \"It's a tough life. It's a great game but it's not an easy life, and if they didn't love it enough, even with the talent, I don't think they would do it.\"   It didn't hurt that Dad had a batting cage in the backyard of their Yorba Linda, Calif., home, or that Mom, having been a college softball player, could hit grounders or catch a bullpen session. Or that the kids knew their way around a Major League clubhouse while still in Little League.   All three Wallach boys were drafted by Dodgers scout Brian Stephenson, who also carries with him the family theme. Stephenson, who pitched for the Cubs organization, also is from a three-generation baseball scout family. His father, Jerry, was a longtime scout for the Dodgers and Red Sox. Jerry's father, Joe, was a legendary scout for Boston.   Now the goal is to get all three Wallach sons to the Major Leagues at the same time to become the modern-day Alou brothers.   \"All of them want to,\" said Tim. \"It would make for awfully proud mother and father.\"   The Ray Boone Family Award is named after the first family to send three generations of players to the Major Leagues -- Ray, son Bob, and grandsons Bret and Aaron. The Boone family was presented with the first award in 2005, followed by the Buzzie Bavasi family in 2006, the Brett family in 2007, the Buddy Bell family in 2008, the Alou family in 2009 and the Mota family in 2010.   In addition to the Wallach family, other honors at the annual gala will go to Al Rosen for the Bud Selig Executive Leadership Award, Frank Robinson for the Player Lifetime Achievement Award, Jim Leyland for the Tommy Lasorda Managerial Achievement Award and Johnny Bench for the Scout's Dream Award.   The Professional Baseball Scouts Foundation has helped baseball scouts in need due to job loss, illness or financial hardships over the past six years through this annual fundraiser.
