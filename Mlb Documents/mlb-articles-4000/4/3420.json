    "body": "MILWAUKEE -- A Brewers spokesman who was with Ryan Braun over the weekend described the outfielder as \"upbeat\" in the face of a possible suspension.  Braun spoke Saturday night in New York while accepting his National League Most Valuable Player Award from the Baseball Writers' Association of America, two days after beginning an appeal for a reported violation of Major League Baseball's Joint Drug Prevention and Treatment Program. Braun spoke of adversity and \"viewing every challenge I've ever faced as an opportunity.\"  \"It's a tough position for him to be in because this is a confidential process,\" Brewers vice president of communications Tyler Barnes said on Monday. \"He really can't say anything. I thought he did a terrific job. It was really a neat experience for everyone who was there, to see Ryan up there being recognized for his accomplishments in 2011.\" Adam McCalvy is a reporter for MLB.com.
