    "body": "KANSAS CITY -- First, it was Alberto Pujols muscling his way onto the Royals' American League schedule. Now, it's Prince Fielder.  When Pujols signed with the Los Angeles Angels, it meant that the Royals would face the former St. Louis slugger in nine games during the 2012 season. Yes, the Royals were lucky enough to have three series, instead of the usual two, against the AL West Angels.  However, when Fielder's reported nine-year, $214 million deal with the Detroit Tigers is official, the Royals' pitchers can look forward to dealing with him twice as often as Pujols this year. The Tigers, also in the AL Central, have 18 games against Kansas City. How much of an impact can Fielder have on the Tigers' lineup?                Dick Kaegel is a reporter for MLB.com.
