    "body": "Despite a rainy Northwest day and a partially open Safeco Field roof due to a broken axle, 4,556 fans took part in the final day of Mariners FanFest on Sunday, bringing the two-day attendance total to 9,774.  Fans got their first introduction to Japanese pitcher Hisashi Iwakuma, who arrived in Seattle just in time to make an appearance.  The 30-year-old right-hander received his new No. 18 jersey and told reporters that he is looking forward to the challenge of pitching in the Major Leagues after 11 seasons in Japan. \"My name is Hisashi Iwakuma, and I'm here to help the team. Thank you,\" Iwakuma said in English before taking questions through an interpreter.   Iwakuma then joined about a dozen of his new teammates in signing autographs and taking part in the five-hour festival.   Iwakuma wasn't the only newcomer to FanFest. Outfielder Trayvon Robinson made his first appearance on Sunday while the other players wrapped up their second day of activities.   \"This is unbelievable,\" said 19-year-old pitching prospect Taijuan Walker. \"It's exciting to meet the fans, answer questions and be around all the kids and stuff. It was an honor to be here.\"   Sunday's events went off without a hitch despite the edges of the field being uncovered by the retractable roof. A broken axle on one of its 128 wheels has prevented full closure since Thursday night, but Mariners officials expect repairs to be completed sometime this week.   The main center panel of the roof was able to be moved over the center of the field, so fans were able to stay dry, for the most part, on a soggy Sunday afternoon.
