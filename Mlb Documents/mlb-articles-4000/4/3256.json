    "body": "ARLINGTON -- Third baseman Adrian Beltre, who dealt with multiple injuries last season -- including a bruised left knee in the postseason -- said he is healthy and ready to go when Spring Training begins next month. \"I feel good,\" Beltre said. \"It's always good. Right now I'm good.\" Beltre will begin his second season with the Rangers, and said he will be in more of a comfort zone now that he's gotten to know his teammates and manager. Beltre tied for fifth in home runs in the American League with 32 despite playing in only 124 games because of a hamstring injury. \"It's going to be easier for me,\" Beltre said. \"I already know the guys. Last year was a process to get to know everybody. Now I know everybody and how they are, and how I can approach guys.\"",
