Antonetti laughed, and the man proceeded with his question during Friday's town hall meeting inside the Idea Center at Playhouse Square.  \"My question of you,\" he said, \"is when the Fausto Carmona facts became known, where were you, what was your first reaction and what did you do after that first reaction?\" Jordan Bastian is a reporter for MLB.com.
