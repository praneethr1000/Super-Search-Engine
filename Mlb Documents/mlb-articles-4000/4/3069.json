    "body": "As a Reds fan, I always wondered what the players were like off the field. I wanted to know all about the team chemistry -- who are the class clowns? The leaders? The nerds? At Redsfest last month, I got a chance to sit down with manager Dusty Baker and get some answers to those burning questions.  Right off the bat (no pun intended!), Baker listed veteran clubhouse presences Scott Rolen, Bronson Arroyo and Miguel Cairo as team leaders. Class clown was an easy question for Baker, too: He chose emerging pitcher Mike Leake, likening him to the cartoon character Dennis the Menace. Drew Stubbs especially stood out to Baker as the resident bookworm.  \"He's always doing a crossword puzzle or reading on his computer,\" Baker said. Baker also discussed the role technology plays in his job. While Baker personally doesn't partake in technology much, he noted that he depends on others to use the Internet to get the information needed to do his job as best he can.   \"I do depend on it so that I can integrate technology and numbers and cyber stuff with all [my baseball] knowledge,\" said Baker. \"One without the other is like not using all the skills that are there.\"   Baker remarked that in being a manager, it is important to strike a balance between reliance on technology and personal know-how.   \"Sometimes you want to use the numbers,\" Baker said, \"and other times use your brain, your feelings, your knowledge, your expertise, and the fact that you've been in the game 42 years.\"   Baker talked about some of the other challenges faced by a Major League manager.   In his opinion, the toughest part of managing is being \"the man in the middle.\"   \"I'm not upper management, and I'm not a player either,\" Baker pointed out. Another challenge is overriding what Baker calls \"basic human negativity and the lack of faith\" in a game that is full of ups and downs.   \"I have to separate myself from [the negativity] by not reading it, by not listening to it, by not reading any blogs or tweets or anything, and trying to remain consistent with myself, therefore keeping my team consistent.\" Meggie Zahneis, winner of the 2011 Breaking Barriers essay contest, earned the job of youth correspondent for MLB.com in the fall of '11.
