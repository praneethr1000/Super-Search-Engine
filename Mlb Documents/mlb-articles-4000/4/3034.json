    "body": "Barry Larkin is a candidate on the National Baseball Hall of Fame ballot for the third year. The Class of 2012 will be announced on Monday. You can watch the announcement show live on an MLB Network simulcast on MLB.com starting at 2 p.m. ET, with the announcement itself at 3 p.m. ET.   Barry Larkin didn't sit around through the holidays dwelling on his chances of election to the National Baseball Hall of Fame as eligible members of the Baseball Writers' Association of America pondered the possibilities.  The ballot for the Class of 2012 was mailed out in early December, and the results of the voting will be announced on Monday. Larkin, the most viable player on a ballot that has no standout first-year candidates, said he found ways to spend his time during that five-week period and was not antsy. Last year, the 12-time National League All-Star and three-time NL Gold Glove Award-winning shortstop -- who played his entire 19-year career at home in Cincinnati -- finished third behind second baseman Roberto Alomar and pitcher Bert Blyleven. The latter pair was inducted into the Hall this past July, along with general manager Pat Gillick, a post-expansion Veterans Committee electee.                  Barry M.
