    "body": "MIAMI -- Third base is becoming overcrowded on the Marlins.  Add another candidate to the list of possibilities. Dallas McPherson, formerly with the Angels, has signed a one-year deal.  The 27-year-old is the latest choice to compete for the position that was vacated when four-time All-Star Miguel Cabrera was traded to the Tigers in December. To make room on the roster for McPherson, left-handed pitcher Chris Seddon was designated for assignment.   McPherson missed the entire 2007 season as he was recovering from back surgery.   In 2006, he appeared in 40 games and batted .261 with seven homers and 13 RBIs in 115 at-bats.   McPherson will compete for the third-base spot with Jose Castillo and Jorge Cantu.
