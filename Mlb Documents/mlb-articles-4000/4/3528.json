    "body": "A day after finalizing the trade that cleared Michael Pineda's spot in their starting rotation, the Mariners signed a possible replacement in veteran right-hander Kevin Millwood.  Millwood, who turned 37 on Christmas Eve, agreed to a Minor League contract and received an invitation to Spring Training.  Word of an agreement between the Mariners and Millwood came Sunday via his own family, through a posting on Facebook by his sister Erika. The Mariners announced the signing on Tuesday. Millwood went 4-3 last season in nine starts for the Rockies, who returned him to the Majors in mid-August after he had spent most of the year in the Minors in the Yankees and Red Sox organizations.     A two-time 18-game winner with the Braves in 1999 and 2002, Millwood reportedly had a chance to remain with Colorado on a $1 million contract with an additional $1 million in incentives.
