    "body": "ARLINGTON -- Darren Oliver's departure from the Rangers became official on Monday. The Blue Jays formally announced they have signed Oliver to a one-year contract worth $4 million with a club option for 2013.  Oliver spent the past two seasons with the Rangers in his third tour of duty with them. He was also with them in 1993-98 and again in 2000-01. He currently ranks sixth all-time in club history with 317 games pitched.  \"This is not the first time I've left,\" Oliver said Monday. \"The contract just didn't work out. That's the part of baseball -- the business side -- that the players don't like. The business side stinks. But you've got to move on. T.R. Sullivan is a reporter for MLB.com.
