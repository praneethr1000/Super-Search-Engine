Executive vice president\/general manager Ben Cherington made the announcement. Terms of the deal were not disclosed, but reports put the deal at $1.75 million. Sweeney hit .265 with 11 doubles, one home run, 25 RBIs, and 34 runs scored in 108 games with the A's last season. He was acquired from Oakland with closer Andrew Bailey on Dec. 28 in exchange for outfielder Josh Reddick and Minor League pitcher Raul Alcantara and first baseman Miles Head. A second-round pick by the White Sox in 2003, Sweeney was eligible for arbitration for the second time. He made $1.4 million in 2011.   Jesse Sanchez is a national reporter for MLB.com.
