    "body": "CINCINNATI -- During Redsfest last month, veteran Reds third baseman Scott Rolen walked past a reporter and, with his usual wry sense of humor, asked, \"Hey, how's your shoulder?\"  Had Rolen been able to stop for a moment, the question that really needed asking was, \"Hey, Scott, how is your shoulder?\"  Rolen's problematic left shoulder, and the rest of his soon-to-be 37-year-old body, will need to be tip-top in 2012 to help contribute to the Reds. The often ailing shoulder, and a subsequent August surgery, limited Rolen to only 65 games last season -- and wiped out most of his second half. Mark Sheldon is a reporter for MLB.com.
