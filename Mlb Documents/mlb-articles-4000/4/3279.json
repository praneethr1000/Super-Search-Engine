    "body": "The reports of Melvin Mora's retirement appear to be premature. Mora, a mercurial utilityman who has played more than a decade in the Major Leagues, told the Baltimore Sun on Monday that he has retired only from playing Winter League ball in his native Venezuela.  Reports late last month said that Mora, who will turn 40 on Feb. 2, had decided to end his playing career.  \"I'm only retired in Venezuela,\" Mora told the Sun. \"It's too far from my family. That's what I was saying there. When I got back [to the United States], my wife is like, 'Are you retired? They say in the paper you are retired.' I'm like, 'No.' I didn't talk to anyone in the U.S. I am not retired here.\" Mora, a two-time All-Star, spent the vast majority of his career with the Orioles. He batted .228 in a reserve role for Arizona last season, but he's perhaps best known for hitting .340 in 2004, a campaign that brought him the American League's Silver Slugger Award at third base.   Mora is a career .277 hitter with 171 home runs and 754 RBIs in 1,556 career games. He was originally signed by the Houston Astros in 1991, and after signing with the Mets as a Minor League free agent in '98, he was acquired by Baltimore in 2000 as part of a trade for shortstop Mike Bordick.
