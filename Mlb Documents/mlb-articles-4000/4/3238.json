    "body": "Just sitting here thinking ...  Barry Larkin, Ken Griffey Jr. and Pete Rose.  They all grew up in Cincinnati, where I also spent a large chunk of my youth, and they all have at least the spirit of their splendid baseball careers in Cooperstown. They rank as The Current, The Future and The Maybe when it comes to the Hall of Fame. That's interesting enough, but consider this: I have a unique connection to all three players.   Let's start with The Current -- Barry Louis Larkin, the prototype for the modern shortstop, who was elected to the Hall of Fame this week by a landslide. He was proficient as a hitter, a fielder and a runner. Plus, courtesy of spending every inning of his 19 Major League seasons with the Cincinnati Reds, he is one of just four Hall of Famers born in the same city in which he played his entire career.   Twelve All-Star Game trips. The 1995 National League Most Valuable Player Award. Three Gold Gloves.   Mostly, Larkin was A-Rod before A-Rod. That's because he was the first Major League shortstop with 30 home runs and 30 stolen bases in the same season.   This is just as impressive: Larkin and I had the same Cincinnati high school football coach.   His name is Steve Klonne, and back in the day, he was the scariest person ever to walk the earth. I'm serious. I experienced Klonne about a decade or so before Larkin, when Ohio State's legendary Woody Hayes was the role model for football coaches throughout the state. This was during an era in which coaches were allowed to do whatever they wished to players that didn't involve a chainsaw or the gas chamber.   More than a few times before Reds games, Larkin and I shivered while sharing Klonne stories, but we both acknowledged that this Mother of All Old-School Football Coaches was effective.   I got Klonne at the start -- literally -- of his coaching career in a Cincinnati suburb called Mount Healthy. Larkin had him during his prime at Moeller, where Klonne consistently challenged for state championships when he wasn't winning them. And, yes, during Larkin's Moeller years, Klonne still was the Klonne that I knew.   Then Larkin told me one day that Klonne had \"mellowed.\"   Mellowed?   So did his style go from brutal to brutal?   \"No, totally different guy,\" Larkin said back then, of Klonne, who had become kinder, gentler during a generation that demanded as much, even from football coaches.   One more Larkin connection: He grew up in the same Cincinnati neighborhood with my sister-in-law, Stephanie.   Now to The Future -- George Kenneth Griffey Jr., who will become one of the few first-ballot picks for Cooperstown. If you exclude steroid-tainted Barry Bonds, only Hank Aaron, Babe Ruth and Willie Mays hit more home runs than Griffey.   He was chosen to 13 All-Star teams. He earned 10 Gold Gloves as one of the best center fielders in history. There were seven Silver Slugger Awards, three Home Run Derby titles, American League MVP Award honors after the 1997 season and a spot on the All-Century Team.   Unlike Larkin, though, Griffey wasn't a lifetime Reds player. And, unlike Larkin, Griffey was born in Donora, Pa. -- the hometown of his father, Ken Sr., a former Major League player, and of Hall of Famer Stan Musial.   Not only that, Ken Jr. spent just nine years with the Reds. Except for a brief stop to the Chicago White Sox, he primarily starred for the Seattle Mariners. He even began and ended his career in the state of Washington, where he spent 13 seasons.   That said, Griffey was a Cincinnati kid.   I know, because I wrote the first story about Griffey in 1978, when he was an eight-year-old pitcher terrorizing others in Cincinnati's equivalent to Little League called Knothole League.   Those young hitters were so afraid of Griffey that they used to shed enough tears to fill the nearby Ohio River before they entered the batter's box. As Griffey's Knothole League coach told me at the time, \"They don't have to bat if they're crying.\"   Which meant Griffey threw a lot of shutouts and no-hitters.   For the longest time, Griffey's parents kept my story of the young Ken Jr. framed and mounted in their home.   Now to The Maybe -- Peter Edward Rose, whose 4,256 hits are more than anybody in baseball history. And he wasn't all-hit and no-field. He won two Gold Gloves along the way.   There were Rose's 17 All-Star Game trips. He won the NL MVP Award in 1973. He collected three World Series rings, and he told me in 1986 after his retirement that he had played in more \"winning\" games than anybody in the history of the four major pro sports leagues in North America.   That was true then, and, according to the Elias Sports Bureau, that remains the case for Rose.   It all makes sense. Baseball plays more games each year than anybody, and Rose was around for 24 seasons. He also was the sparkplug for Cincinnati's Big Red Machine, one of baseball's greatest dynasties.   Which leads to this: Rose joins Larkin as a Cincinnati native, but unlike Larkin, Rose spent his first 16 Major League seasons with the Reds, and then he bolted for the Philadelphia Phillies as a free agent. He spent five years in Philadelphia. Then he joined the Montreal Expos for a year before he finished his last three seasons with the Reds.     Hall of Fame stuff? No doubt, but those self-inflicted gambling issues are keeping Rose from Hall of Fame consideration.     Well, unless Rose gets re-instated someday from baseball's permanently ineligible list.     My ties to Rose are numerous. Soon after we moved as a family from South Bend, Ind., to Cincinnati in 1968, Rose became my favorite player. I got a chance to know him up close and personal as a back-up Reds beat writer for the Cincinnati Enquirer during the latter 1970s.   While operating as a sports journalist in general, I was there during most of Rose's 44-game hitting streak, which is second only to Joe DiMaggio's 56. I was there when Rose broke Ty Cobb's all-time hits record. I also was there when Rose called a news conference to say he did not bet on baseball before he confessed years later that he did.   Maybe I'll be there in Cooperstown to see Rose join Larkin and Griffey, but that's a big \"maybe\" at this point.  Terence Moore is a columnist for MLB.com.
