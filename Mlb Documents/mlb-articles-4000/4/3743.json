    "body": "ST. LOUIS -- Though an early April return still seems overly optimistic, Cardinals outfielder Allen Craig said that his recovery from knee surgery remains right on track following a November procedure to repair a fractured right kneecap.  Craig will travel to Florida later this week and resume his rehab work there, a month before he is joined by teammates for the opening of Spring Training. He has not yet been cleared to run, but Craig has begun light strengthening exercises and no longer has any restrictions while walking.  \"I feel great,\" Craig said on Monday. \"Standing here now I have full range of motion. I'm walking fine. I'm doing light body squats. I didn't expect to be doing that at this point. Obviously, time tables are tough because you don't know what's going to happen in the future. I'm just taking it one day at a time, but I am kind of surprised with how good I feel at this point.\" While Craig has his sights set on a full recovery by Opening Day, the Cardinals are still preparing for the possibility that he will be sidelined for the first month of the season. Recovery from this particular type of procedure is typically four-to-six months.   The decision to undergo knee surgery came after Craig discussed his options with multiple surgeons. The consensus was that while Craig could keep playing without addressing the source of pain, he would not be able to hold down an everyday role for the long term without surgery.   \"The doctor said if you want to have a long career, it's something that you need to get fixed,\" said Craig, who sustained the injury running into an outfield wall at Minute Maid Park last June. He missed the next two months.   \"It took me a while to prepare for the games, to get warmed up. It was just stiff, a little sharp pain here or there. It's something that you can't keep up over the long course of a season.\"   A healthy Craig will bolster the Cardinals' depth chart and leave manager Mike Matheny with the enviable task of finding ways to get the 27-year-old regular at-bats. Craig could spell Lance Berkman at first. He'd also be an option to play any of the outfield spots.   In 75 regular-season games last year, Craig batted .315 with a .362 on-base percentage, 11 homers and 40 RBIs. While continuing to nurse the knee injury, Craig also contributed four homers and eight RBIs during the postseason. Jenifer Langosch is a reporter for MLB.com.
