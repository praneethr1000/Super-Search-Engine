    "body": "The appeal of the Chicago Cubs is the promise of a new day. A day that hangs on the horizon. Of course, this is nothing new. Theo Epstein didn't invent the hope that huddles in the hearts of Cubs fans. He's merely the latest -- and, you could easily argue, the most competent -- begetter of their belief in a brighter day. He's also the most eloquent, as he demonstrated on the day he was introduced as the team's new president of baseball operations. Anthony Castrovince is a reporter for MLB.com.
