    "body": "The word \"volatile\" is often tossed around in regard to relief pitching, and the same word applies to a discussion of this winter's relief market.  What better way to describe a market in which Jonathan Papelbon received a four-year, $50 million commitment from the Phillies, while the man he replaced, Ryan Madson, settled for one year and $8.5 million with the Reds?  That's plenty volatile, especially when you remember that the Phillies, whether or not they made an actual offer or came to an actual agreement, had considered a $44 million, four-year pact with Madson before turning to \"Cinco Ocho.\" Anthony Castrovince is a reporter for MLB.com.
