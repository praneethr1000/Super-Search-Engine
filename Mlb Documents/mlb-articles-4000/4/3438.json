    "body": "The Red Sox have reportedly signed free-agent outfielder Cody Ross, according to Ken Rosenthal of FOXSports.com and Pete Abraham of the Boston Globe. The one-year deal is reportedly worth $3 million, plus possible bonuses based on the amount of plate appearances he makes. The team is said to be \"optimistic\" about inking Ross, who turned 31 in December and hit .240 with 14 home runs and 52 RBIs during the 2011 season with the San Francisco Giants. A postseason hero for the Giants during their championship run in 2010, Ross will give the Red Sox some depth in the outfield, with Carl Crawford not expected to be ready before the start of the season and Mike Aviles likely to play more at shortstop than expected.
