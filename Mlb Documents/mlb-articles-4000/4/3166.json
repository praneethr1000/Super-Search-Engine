    "body": "PHILADELPHIA -- When the new wave of ballparks began sprouting up around the big leagues during the 1990s, Major League Baseball Commissioner Bud Selig knew that harkening back to the intimacy of old-school designs would have a significant impact on the way baseball games might be played and seen.  What he didn't know back then is that those yards would have a big impact on the way National Hockey League games are played, too. And so it was on Monday that the Bridgestone Winter Classic was staged at 8-year-old Citizens Bank Park in front of 46,967 fans decked out in Flyers orange and black and Rangers blue.  The two rivals played a dandy, with the New York squad prevailing, 3-2, as Rangers goalie Henrik Lundqvist turned away Flyers center Danny Briere on what could have been a game-tying penalty shot with just a tick under 20 seconds left in the third period. But the venue was just as much a star as the players on the ice. On Monday, Phillies center fielder Shane Victorino flew in especially to see the Classic as a part of a more inclusive East Coast trip.        Barry M.
