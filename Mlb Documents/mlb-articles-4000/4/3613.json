Martin hit .237 with 18 home runs and 65 RBIs in 125 games during the 2011 season, his first with the Yanks. He also added 17 doubles and scored 57 runs. Martin led Major League catchers with 40 baserunners caught stealing in 2011 on his way to making his third All-Star team. Quinn Roberts is a contributor for MLB.com.
