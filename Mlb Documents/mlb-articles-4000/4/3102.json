    "body": "ARLINGTON -- Pitcher Yu Darvish and his father have returned to Japan after his visit to Arlington this week. The Rangers confirmed the visit, but general manager Jon Daniels is adhering to his policy of not commenting about Darvish while negotiations are ongoing.  \"It's best for us to lay low,\" Daniels said. \"The less noise around that, the better.\"  The Rangers, submitting a bid of approximately $51.7 million, won the rights to negotiate with Darvish and have until 4 p.m. CT on Jan. 18 to sign him to a Major League contract. Otherwise he will return to the Nippon Ham Fighters in Japan. ",
