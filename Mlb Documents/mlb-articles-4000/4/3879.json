    "body": "The Milwaukee Brewers have a tentative agreement on a one-year contract with free-agent outfielder Mike Cameron, pending a physical early next week.  Brewers general manager Doug Melvin confirmed the potential deal Friday night. Cameron, who turned 35 on Jan. 8, would start in center field for Milwaukee, which would prompt the team to move Bill Hall to third base and Ryan Braun to left field.  \"We've talked to both of them and both are fine with it, and they recognize Mike is the type of player who can make us better,\" Melvin said of Hall and Braun. Cameron, who began his career in 1995 with the Chicago White Sox and has played for the Cincinnati Reds, Seattle Mariners, New York Mets and San Diego Padres, has a career .251 average. He hit .242 with 21 homers and 78 RBIs in 151 games last season with the Padres.   According to the Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel, Cameron would receive a $1.25 million signing bonus plus a $5 million salary in 2008. However, he will be suspended the first 25 games of the season for testing positive for a banned stimulant, and won't be paid for those games, which means the salary will be reduced to $4.22 million.   The Brewers also hold a $10 million option on Cameron for 2009 with a $750,000 buyout, according to the Journal-Sentinel. Carrie Muskat is a reporter for MLB.com.
