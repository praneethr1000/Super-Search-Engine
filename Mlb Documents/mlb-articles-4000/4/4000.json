    "body": "MILWAUKEE -- The uncertainty surrounding National League MVP Ryan Braun has not hurt the Brewers at the box office, the team's chief operating officer said Sunday.  As fans began filling the Frontier Airlines Center for this year's version of Brewers On Deck, COO Rick Schlesinger said the team expects to parlay its 2011 NL Central title into a record-setting sales season in 2012, whether or not Braun is on the field for Opening Day.  \"Our ticket sales have been tremendous,\" Schlesinger said. \"We are well ahead of last year, and we are expecting to have an all-time attendance record. Our numbers have been great.\" Adam McCalvy is a reporter for MLB.com. Read his blog, Brew Beat, and follow him on Twitter at @AdamMcCalvy.
