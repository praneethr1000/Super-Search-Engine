    "body": "DENVER -- Big brothers might delight in the younger one's pain and suffering, but it's all out of love. Rockies power-hitting third-base prospect Nolan Arenado got a glimpse of that in Las Vegas this winter.  Veteran Jason Giambi organized the torture. He is 41, and age-wise is closer to a dad than a big brother to Arenado, who doesn't turn 21 until April 16. Troy Tulowitzki is 27. Dexter Fowler turns 26 on March 22. Contorting in the heat while performing Bikram yoga can be a chore at any age, but to hear Arenado say it, youth was not his ally.  \"I've done hard stuff, but nothing like Bikram yoga,\" Arenado said. \"I remember it getting really tough, messing with my mind. I was thinking, 'Do I really want to be doing this?' But I realize that it was as much a workout mentally as physically, and that mental preparation will help me.\" This year's edition of MLB.com's Top Prospects list has expanded from 50 to 100 players. The annual ranking of baseball's biggest and brightest young talent is assembled by MLB.com's Draft and prospect expert Jonathan Mayo, who compiles input from industry sources, including scouts and scouting directors. It is based on analysis of players' skill sets, upsides, closeness to the Majors and potential immediate impact to their teams. The list, which is one of several prospect rankings on MLB.com's Prospect Watch, only includes players with rookie status in 2012.              Thomas Harding is a reporter for MLB.com.
