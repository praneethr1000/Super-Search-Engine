    "body": "NEW YORK -- Alex Rodriguez says that his offseason workouts are going well and that he plans to do most of his work helping the Yankees in the field, not as a designated hitter.  The 36-year-old Rodriguez told ESPN Deportes that he expects several players to help fill New York's DH role this season, in the wake of last week's trade that sent power-hitting prospect Jesus Montero to the Mariners.  \"I think the vision for us as a team is now ... you want the DH spot to be one that's kind of a revolving door,\" Rodriguez said in the interview. \"I think a lot of us at some point or another, in such a long season, are going occupy that spot. But for me, I'm really excited about playing third base.\" Rodriguez said that he is proceeding on track this winter after visiting a German doctor in early December to undergo Orthokine treatment on his troublesome right knee and left shoulder.   The procedure, which was vetted by the Yankees in cooperation with Major League Baseball, was recommended to Rodriguez by basketball star Kobe Bryant. Rodriguez was treated by Dr. Peter Wehling in Dusseldorf.   \"I feel pretty good right now and I hope that [the procedure] helps me stay healthy and have ... a great year on the field,\" Rodriguez said. \"My workouts are going great and I'm looking forward to report day on Feb. 24 [to] get started and have a great year for the Yankees.\"   Rodriguez has high hopes after last Friday's trade, in which the Yankees acquired right-hander Michael Pineda and Minor League pitcher Jose Campos by shipping Montero and right-hander Hector Noesi to Seattle, a deal that hasn't yet been formally announced because of pending physicals.   The slugger told ESPN Deportes that he believed the trade \"makes sense on both ends.\"   \"It's a good trade for both teams,\" Rodriguez said. \"I think the Mariners are going to receive two very good young players. Jesus is a guy who has a lot of power and a lot of potential and is going to help out their team a lot. And Hector is a pitcher that is going to throw strikes and can either help them on the front end or the back end of the bullpen.  \"For us, we get exactly what we need -- one of the best young pitchers in the game with an electric arm and great size. I think [Pineda will] be a great complement to what Brian Cashman has in New York, which is a lot of young talent and someone who can be sandwiched somewhere between CC Sabathia, A.J. Burnett and Ivan Nova.\"   The Yankees faced Pineda on May 27 last season in Seattle, and Rodriguez went 1-for-2 with an RBI single, strikeout and walk against the hurler. Rodriguez recalled that the matchup \"wasn't a lot of fun.\"   \"He has three plus pitches and throws up in the mid 90s,\" Rodriguez said. \"Again, he's quite a figure out there; he's 6-7 and has a long reach, and I'm glad I don't have to face him anymore.\"   Baseball's active home run leader with 629, Rodriguez batted .276 with 16 home runs and 62 RBIs in 99 games last season, making 87 starts at third base and 10 as a DH.   Rodriguez was slowed by a meniscus tear in his right knee, sending him to the disabled list in early July, and a sprained left thumb suffered in his first game back Aug. 21.
