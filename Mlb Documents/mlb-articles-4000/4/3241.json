    "body": "PHOENIX -- Could Bartolo Colon be the fifth starter the D-backs have been looking for?  The D-backs seem to believe so, as a baseball source has said they are in talks to sign the right-hander.  Colon went 8-10 with a 4.00 ERA in 29 games (26 starts) for the Yankees last season. The 38-year-old did not pitch in 2010 and signed a Minor League deal with the Yankees after undergoing stem cell treatment for injuries to his elbow and rotator cuff. Thanks to a strong performance in the spring, Colon made the Yankees' roster and was an effective starter before seeming to tire down the stretch. In September he posted a 5.96 ERA and was left off the team's postseason roster.   The D-backs' rotation currently consists of Ian Kennedy, Daniel Hudson, Trevor Cahill and Josh Collmenter, with the fifth spot set to come from a group of young pitchers that includes, among others, Wade Miley, Barry Enright, Tyler Skaggs, Trevor Bauer and Charles Brewer.   Given the youth and inexperience of that group, the D-backs had hoped to add a veteran fifth starter as added depth in case none of the young pitchers is able to make the jump to the big leagues.
