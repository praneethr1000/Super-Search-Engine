    "body": "The White Sox announced on Tuesday that Major League Baseball Commissioner Bud Selig will attend the opening night of SoxFest 2012.  Selig is slated to present White Sox chairman Jerry Reinsdorf with the 2011 Commissioner's Award for Philanthropic Excellence, which the club learned it had won in November. He will also take part in a seminar with White Sox fans.  The Commissioner's Award was created in 2010 to recognize outstanding community efforts by a Major League club. The White Sox are being acknowledged for the \"White Sox Volunteer Corps\" program, a unique initiative designed to activate the club's fan base to help give back to the greater Chicago community through service.
