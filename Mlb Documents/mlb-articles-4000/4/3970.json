    "body": "MINNEAPOLIS -- Twins right-handers Nick Blackburn and Scott Baker said during TwinsFest that they're both healthy and on track to be ready to go once pitchers and catchers report to Spring Training on Feb. 18.  Blackburn underwent surgery on Oct. 1 to decompress the radial nerve in his right forearm after being diagnosed with Radial Tunnel Syndrome. The surgery essentially loosened up an inflamed nerve that was causing discomfort in his forearm.  He said he had to wear a cast for 11 days after the surgery, but that rehab went well and that he started his throwing program right on schedule shortly after Christmas. ",
