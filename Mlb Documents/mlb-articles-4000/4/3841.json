    "body": "The Texas Rangers avoided arbitration with Ben Broussard on Saturday by signing the first baseman to a one-year deal worth $3.85 million, plus incentives. Also, Broussard will make a donation to the Texas Rangers Foundation.  The Rangers acquired the 31-year-old Broussard, who is expected to be their starting first baseman, from the Seattle Mariners on Dec. 12 in exchange for Triple-A second baseman Tug Hulett.  The left-handed-hitting Broussard hit .275 with seven home runs and 29 RBIs in 240 at-bats in 2007. In six years in the Majors for the Mariners and Cleveland Indians, Broussard has a career average of .267 with 84 home runs and 306 RBIs. Broussard has three pinch-hit grand slams in his career, which is tied for the most in Major League history.   The Rangers now have two remaining players eligible for arbitration: outfielder Marlon Byrd and catcher Gerald Laird.  T.R. Sullivan is a reporter for MLB.com.
