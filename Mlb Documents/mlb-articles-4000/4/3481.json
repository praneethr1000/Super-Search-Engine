    "body": "SAN FRANCISCO -- The five-year, $100 million contract offer that the Giants reportedly lobbed at Tim Lincecum made complete sense. It made sense for management, because if Lincecum were to accept, the Giants would have a bargain. So it made sense for Lincecum to rebuff San Francisco's attempt to secure his services through his final two arbitration-eligible seasons and his first three years of free agency. He conceivably could do much better if or when he enters free agency, for which he is eligible after the 2013 season. According to STATS, Lincecum has thrown an NL-high 14,164 pitches since beginning his first full season in the Majors in 2008. So he has proven his durability or eroded his physical capacities, depending on one's point of view.     Chris Haft is a reporter for MLB.com.
