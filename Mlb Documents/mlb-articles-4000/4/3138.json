    "body": "A division not always used to making headlines, the National League Central has been the epicenter for baseball news over the past three months. From the Cardinals' World Series run to the Reds' win-now makeover, no division topped the NL Central for intriguing developments over the final quarter of 2011.  As 2012 opens, the intrigue doesn't figure to diminish. Rather, it may increase. The top three contenders all will feature significantly different looks for the new season, while the three teams chasing them continue trying to build toward brighter futures.  Reigning division champion Milwaukee -- remember, the team that finished six games ahead of the World Series champion Cardinals -- seems resigned to losing the face of its franchise. Free-agent slugger Prince Fielder remains without a home, but returning to the Brewers appears low on his list. Add in the potential absence of Ryan Braun for the season's first 50 games, and the Brewers will have to win games in a different way than they did in 2011. Beyond those three, there could again be a gap, as the division's other three clubs seem focused on the longer term rather than the immediate. To their credit, however, the Pirates, Astros and Cubs all seem to be rebuilding in earnest. None of the three clubs seems terribly worried about putting on a better face next year if it means hindering the grand plan.
