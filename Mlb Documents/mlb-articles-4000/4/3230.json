    "body": "BOSTON -- Agent Fernando Cuza confirmed that he met with Red Sox general manager Ben Cherington on Friday in Boston to discuss David Ortiz's contract situation.  The Red Sox are due to exchange salary arbitration figures with Ortiz by Tuesday. The design of the meeting was to see if an agreement could be reached before then.  \"I think both sides expressed their positions and that's where everything is right now,\" Cuza said from a Jimmy Fund charity event across the street from Fenway Park. \"I can't talk any more about it.\" At this stage, it does not appear a deal will be worked out before the exchange of arbitration figures. However, the sides are still free to negotiate before a potential arbitration hearing in February.   During Theo Epstein's nine-year regime as general manager in Boston, he never went to salary arbitration with a player.   Ortiz made $12.5 million last season, when he hit .309 with 29 homers and 96 RBIs. Once he accepted Boston's offer of arbitration, he guaranteed himself a raise for 2012, perhaps in the range of $14-16 million.   Ortiz would like the security of a multi-year deal. The Red Sox would be willing to do one if it was in the right price range.   Several other Sox players filed for salary arbitration, including closer Andrew Bailey, righty Daniel Bard, center fielder Jacoby Ellsbury, righty Alfredo Aceves, lefty Franklin Morales and catcher Jarrod Saltalamacchia.",
