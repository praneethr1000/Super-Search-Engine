    "body": "SAN DIEGO -- The Padres agreed to terms with right-handed pitcher Dustin Moseley on Tuesday, the last of their 11 arbitration-eligible players.  \"We had a lot of people working on it, assistants, people who work for me, above me,\" said Josh Stein, the Padres director of baseball operations, of wading through the crush of contracts.  \"[GM Josh Byrnes] helped with a couple of them, too. [Vice president of strategy and business analysis] John Abbamondi came over from the business side. It was really a team effort.\" Moseley agreed to a deal that will pay him $2.0125 million in 2012. He had asked for $2.55 million. The club offered $1.5 million.   Moseley was 3-10 with a 3.30 ERA in 20 starts for the Padres in 2011. His season ended early after he landed on the disabled list on July 31 with a strained left (non-throwing) shoulder that had given him trouble in the past but didn't in 2011 until he injured it swinging a bat in an Interleague game.   Moseley eventually had surgery to repair the shoulder that he dislocated twice during the season. He will head to Spring Training with the rest of the pitchers and catchers for a Feb. 19 report date.   He's expected to contend for a spot at the back end of the starting rotation this spring.   Moseley had the worst run support for any pitcher in baseball with at least 20 starts (2.55 runs per start). Tim Lincecum of the Giants was next on the list at 2.94 runs per start.   The Padres previously agreed to deals with the following arbitration-players: Pitcher Clayton Richard ($2.705 million), pitcher Joe Thatcher ($700,000), catcher John Baker ($750,000), third baseman Chase Headley ($3.475 million), outfielder Carlos Quentin ($7.025 million), catcher Nick Hundley ($2 million), pitcher Luke Gregerson ($1.55 million), pitcher Edinson Volquez ($2.2375 million), outfielder Will Venable ($1.475 million) and pitcher Tim Stauffer ($3.2 million).
