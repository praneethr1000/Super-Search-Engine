    "body": "MILWAUKEE -- For nearly a decade, general manager Doug Melvin has driven all of the Brewers' big decisions. In this instance, he's stuck on the sidelines with everyone else.  The fate of left fielder and face-of-the-franchise Ryan Braun reportedly rests in the hands of a three-member panel in New York. Braun is charged with violating Major League Baseball's Joint Drug Prevention and Treatment Program and faces a 50-game suspension, which, if levied, would deal a harsh blow to the Brewers' bid to defend their National League Central crown and would tarnish the NL Most Valuable Player Award trophy Braun is to accept Saturday night.  The New York Daily News was first to report Thursday that Braun's appeal had begun, another leak in a saga that began when ESPN reported on Dec. 10 that Braun had submitted a urine sample during the postseason that tested for a high level of testosterone. Braun's camp immediately went on the offensive, citing \"highly unusual circumstances surrounding this case which will support Ryan's complete innocence and demonstrate that there was absolutely no intentional violation of the program.\" Adam McCalvy is a reporter for MLB.com.
