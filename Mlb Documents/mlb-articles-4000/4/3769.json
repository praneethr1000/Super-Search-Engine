    "body": "BALTIMORE -- Aubrey Huff became Baltimore's first offseason casualty Thursday night, when the designated hitter announced through the Orioles that he will undergo surgery to repair a sports hernia on Friday in Philadelphia. Huff, who hit 15 home runs last year, is expected to be able to resume full activity in six weeks.  That return date could cause him to miss the first few days of Spring Training, which are generally reserved for sprints and light conditioning. Huff, a notoriously slow starter throughout his career, followed that same pattern in 2007, but also hit for the cycle and posted batting averages of .363 and .330 in the final two months of the season.  Huff pitched in at both infield corners last season and is expected to play the same role in 2008. His role took on added significance last month, when Baltimore traded primary power source Miguel Tejada to the Astros. Huff, who had hit at least 20 home runs for five straight years before 2007, is one of the few remaining Orioles with a consistent track record. The 31-year-old should be back well before Grapefruit League games start in early March, leaving Baltimore to sort out playing time between veterans Kevin Millar and Jay Gibbons. Huff, who will be rehabbing for the rest of the time before the team convenes in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., may be one of the only players you can eliminate from potential trade talk.   The Orioles have been connected to the Chicago Cubs in talks for second baseman Brian Roberts, and to Seattle and Cincinnati in discussions regarding staff ace Erik Bedard. Fellow veterans Millar, Jay Payton and Ramon Hernandez have also been involved in trade rumors, but none quite as contagious as those involving Roberts and Bedard.   Fine-tuning: Demolition began on the center-field scoreboard at Camden Yards on Thursday, making way for the enhancements Baltimore plans to unveil for Opening Day. The right-field scoreboard and club-level displays had already been removed the week before and will be replaced by next-generation LED boards.     Baltimore will install a state-of-the-art videoboard in center field and an equally cutting edge scoreboard in right field. The next phase for ballpark improvement will involve an improved sound system and high-definition televisions throughout the ballpark. That part of the process is expected to be completed by the start of the 2009 season.   Greg Bader, the team's director of communications, released a statement to address the initiative.   \"Upgrading the Oriole Park scoreboards, sound system and control room to state-of-the-art quality has been the Orioles' goal for many years,\" it said. \"And we are pleased to witness today's important step in this process.\"   Stockpile: With rotation slots earmarked for Bedard, Adam Loewen, Daniel Cabrera and Jeremy Guthrie, the Orioles have quite a bit of competition lined up for one vacant spot. Southpaws Garrett Olson and Troy Patton will compete with right-handers Matt Albers, Hayden Penn and Radhames Liz to see who's the best immediate fit.   That likely leaves Brian Burres back in a relief role, and the bullpen will probably swallow up a few of the other candidates for starting jobs. The Orioles are steadily building the upper-level depth they've coveted for years, a commodity that will allow them to take their time with low-level arms like Chorye Spoone, Brandon Erbe and Pedro Beato.   That same depth is missing from the bullpen, where Baltimore would like to patch together a relief staff around situational specialists Jamie Walker and Chad Bradford. Waiver claim Greg Aquino will play a role in that effort, as will Rule 5 Draft pick Randor Bierd and hard-throwing organizational arms like Jim Hoey and Bob McCrory.
