    "body": "NEW YORK -- For the good of the game, Rich \"Goose\" Gossage said on Tuesday, players who used performance-enhancing drugs should \"fess up and then get on with life.\"  On the day Gossage was elected by a wide margin into the National Baseball Hall of Fame, the right-handed closer was asked during a conference call whether superstar players of the so-called \"steroid area,\" such as Roger Clemens and Barry Bonds, are cheaters.  Bonds, the all-time leader with 762 homers, is being tried in a San Francisco court on four counts of perjury and one for obstruction of justice after allegedly lying to a grand jury about his drug use. Clemens, the active leader with 354 victories, was named in the Mitchell Report as having been injected with multiple shots of steroids and human growth hormone during a four-year period from 1998 to 2001.
