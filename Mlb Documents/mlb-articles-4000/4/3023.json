    "body": "ST. LOUIS -- Carlos Beltran's contract with the Cardinals will pay him an even $26 million over its two guaranteed seasons, MLB.com has learned. It's a relatively straightforward deal with no incentives based on plate appearances or games played.  Beltran will receive $13 million in 2012 and $13 million in '13, and as previously reported, contains full no-trade protection. He has bonuses written into the deal for All-Star selection, Gold Glove and Silver Slugger awards, top-5 Most Valuable Player finishes and MVP awards in the National League Championship Series and World Series.  Beltran's deal also states that he will donate $25,000 each year to Cardinals Care. The outfielder is expected to make his first public appearance as a Cardinal at this weekend's Winter Warm-Up. As a matter of club policy, the Cardinals do not disclose contract terms.",
