    "body": "BALTIMORE-- Luke Scott's memorable four-year career with the Orioles came to a close Thursday as the Rays signed the free-speaking slugger to a one-year deal, with a club option for 2013.  \"I feel great about my decision,\" said Scott, who said talks with the Orioles never reached a point where they extended a formal offer to him. \"It was a blessing to play in Baltimore in front of these people. It's something I will take with me forever.  \"I had wonderful memories of my time there. And I just want to express my gratitude to all the fans and my teammates who made my experience so great over the years.\" Named the team's Most Valuable Oriole after a 2010 campaign that saw him hit a career-high 27 homers with 72 RBIs, Scott struggled with a nagging right shoulder injury that started last spring and sapped his power in 2011. After several attempts to work through his right labrum injury, Scott, who became a free agent when Baltimore non-tendered him, underwent season-ending surgery at the end of July and finished the season with nine homers and 22 RBIs in 64 games.   Scott, who makes his offseason home in De Leon Springs, Fla., has remained optimistic throughout the rehab process that he will be able make a full recovery and regain his offense. He expects to be full-go hitting wise in Spring Training and is shooting for May to be able to play the outfield. A career .264 hitter with 112 homers in parts of seven Major League seasons, the addition of Scott gives the Rays a left-handed power bat that can be used at designated hitter, left field and first base.   \"The deciding factor was this: I wanted to be with a team that would be excited to have me,\" Scott said. \"Because at the end of the day, this is my livelihood, this is how I make a living. And if a team wants me, I'm all for it. I wanted to go somewhere where I'm going to get a good chance to play every day and contribute.\"   After Baltimore decided not to offer a contract to Scott, who earned $6.4 million in 2011, it didn't completely rule out his return, with executive vice president of baseball operations Dan Duquette saying earlier in the week that the club had remained in contact with Scott's camp. But with several other teams intrigued by Scott's power, the Rays' offer and persistence won out, giving one of the most popular Orioles a new address.   \"I'm very appreciative of the fan base and their support,\" Scott said of his time in Baltimore. \"I'm humbled by it.\"   Baltimore's ace, Jeremy Guthrie, upon hearing the news Wednesday, took to his Twitter account to say: \"Happy trails Luke Scott. One of my [favorite] teammates & [people] I've met in this great game of baseball.\"   Outspoken and always optimistic, Scott created national headlines for speaking out about his political beliefs, comments which were first made at baseball's 2010 Winter Meetings. An avid hunter, Scott has also spoke openly about gun rights and his devout Christian beliefs, a religious overhaul that began while attending Oklahoma State University.   But Scott, who was acquired by the Orioles prior to the 2008 season in a trade with the Astros for Miguel Tejada, could also make news with his bat, with teammates nicknaming his home runs \"happy homers,\" given the ear-to-ear grin and celebration that followed each blast. Baltimore is still hoping to fill its designated-hitter role, although it's not viewed as a top priority for the club.   \"It's still under consideration,\" Duquette said of the likelihood the team will sign a DH this offseason. \"We are trying to decide what we are going to do with that.\"   Manager Buck Showalter echoed Duquette's sentiment, and he said it's equally possible the club won't get a DH-type bat and will fill the position internally with a rotation of position players.   \"There [are] benefits to both sides of it,\" Showalter said. \"We kind of saw last year with [Vladimir] Guerrero, how we got anchored down with [having a DH-only player].   \"I think there's some benefit to not having the DH spot completely anchored down with a one-dimensional guy, but at the same time, we're still having conversations.\" Brittany Ghiroli is a reporter for MLB.com.
