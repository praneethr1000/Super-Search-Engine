    "body": "MINNEAPOLIS -- While the Twins starting rotation is expected to be very young in 2008, the club at the very least will have the presence of some veteran starting pitchers during Spring Training.  The Twins announced their 2008 non-roster Spring Training invitees on Friday, and included in the 17 players invited to Fort Myers, Fla., are right-hander Zach Day and left-hander Randy Keisler. Both were signed to Minor League deals earlier this week.  Day, 29, went 18-19 with a 4.01 ERA while pitching for the Expos from 2002-04. He pitched in 12 games for the organization after it moved to Washington in 2005 before being traded to Colorado. Day underwent rotator cuff surgery in June 2006, and he signed a Minor League deal with the Royals prior to last season. Kelly Thesier is a reporter for MLB.com.
