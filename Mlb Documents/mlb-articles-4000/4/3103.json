    "body": "ARLINGTON -- The Rangers have hired Josh Hamilton's father-in-law as a special staff assistant. Michael Dean Chadwick, father of Katie Hamilton, will fill the support role for Josh that Johnny Narron did the previous four years. Chadwick and Hamilton have a relationship that goes back many years.  Chadwick, who is also a recovering addict, was instrumental from the beginning in helping Hamilton in his recovery from drug and alcohol problems. Chadwick has worked for other professional sports teams, including the Washington Redskins.  Narron served in two roles for the Rangers. He was Hamilton's mentor and guardian and, with a baseball background, he served as the Rangers' assistant hitting coach. He was hired by the Rangers right after they acquired Hamilton from the Reds four years ago. He was hired earlier in the winter by the Brewers as their hitting coach. ",
