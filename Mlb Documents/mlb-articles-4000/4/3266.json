    "body": "KANSAS CITY -- Got a joke? How about this one:  What do you call a pig that does karate? A pork chop.  That was a joke told by Royals pitcher Bruce Chen, eliciting a resounding chuckle or two, during an impromptu standup comedy appearance last summer at the MLB Fan Cave in New York. Can you do better? Sure you can and now's your chance. The Royals have announced a Joke of the Day promotion for the 2012 season. Fans are asked to submit their favorite funny line with the chance that Chen will deliver it on the Kauffman Stadium CrownVision board during a game next season.   Fans can submit a joke in 300 characters or less to royals.com\/jokes by Friday, Feb. 10.   What do you call a deer with no eyes? No idea-r.   Get it? Maybe not. Say it, \"No eye-dee-r.\" That was another Chen joke. Obviously he needs better material. Now's your chance. Dick Kaegel is a reporter for MLB.com.
