    "body": "Tony Sanchez's offseason got off to a troubling start, according to a published report that the Pirates' top pick in the 2009 First-Year Player Draft suffered a broken jaw in a barroom scuffle.  Pirates officials have not commented on the report in the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review that Sanchez was injured three months ago while he was participating in the Florida instructional league.  That would put the time of the incident at mid-October, weeks after the 23-year-old catcher concluded his third Minor League campaign in the Pirates' organization. He spent all season with Double-A Altoona, batting .241 with five homers and 44 RBIs in 402 at-bats. Tom Singer is a national reporter for MLB.com. Follow @Tom_Singer on Twitter.
