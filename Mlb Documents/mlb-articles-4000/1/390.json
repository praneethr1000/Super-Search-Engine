    "body": "Rick Magnante, who'll manage the South African squad in the inaugural World Baseball Classic in March, wasn't kidding when he said his team would be green.  Provisional WBC rosters were released Wednesday, and of the 40 South African players -- the roster will be cut to 30 before the tournament begins -- only four have played professional baseball.  None of them have advanced beyond Double-A ball. Two of them haven't gotten out of rookie ball. \"My god,\" Magnante told MLB.com last week. \"We're going to be like the Lilliputians out there.\"   During that discussion, Magnante mentioned one player by name: Barry Armitage, a 6-foot-5, 255-pound righty reliever in the Kansas City Royals organization, who went 4-3 with a 3.87 ERA in 41 games with the Double-A Wichita Wranglers in 2005.   \"He's a big kid with a good arm,\" Magnante said of Armitage, 26. \"I honestly don't know much else about him.\"   Also on the roster from the Royals chain is Bruce McCleland, another 6-foot-5 hurler who pitched in three games for the Idaho Falls Chukars of the Pioneer League (rookie ball) last season. Rounding out the short list of pros expected to play for South Africa are shortstop Paul Rutgers, who batted .230 in 70 games for the Beloit Snappers (Minnesota Twins, Class A), and Donavon Hendricks, who went 1-2 with a 6.99 ERA in 17 games for the Danville Braves (Atlanta Braves, rookie ball).   \"At some point,\" said Magnante, a longtime Oakland A's scout, \"we're going to be sending high school guys out there to face like Derek Jeter and Barry Bonds and Ken Griffey [Jr.] in a big league ballpark. And obviously at that point, nerves become a factor, too.\"   South Africa is in Pool B, which also features the United States, Canada and Mexico. Pool play starts in Arizona on March 7, before which Magnante will run a training camp at Papago Park, Oakland's Minor League complex in Phoenix.   \"This,\" Magnante conceded, \"is a team that's a huge underdog.\"  Mychael Urban is a national writer for MLB.com.
