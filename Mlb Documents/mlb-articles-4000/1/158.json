    "subtitle": "Five face Sunday deadline",
    "body": "A Sunday deadline looms for five players who declined arbitration.  If they do not re-sign by the end of the day Sunday, the players in question cannot re-sign with their 2005 club until after May 1, which essentially ends their ties with their respective organizations.  That would leave each of the players with 29 potential employers instead of 30, with time winding down before Spring Training reporting dates. Jim Molony is a national reporter for MLB.com. This story was not subject to the approval of Major League Baseball or its clubs.",
