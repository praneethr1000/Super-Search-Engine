    "body": "MINNEAPOLIS -- The Twins are adding two members to their Hall of Fame, as outfielder Torii Hunter and broadcaster John Gordon both were elected, the club announced at their annual media luncheon before TwinsFest on Friday. A year after no one was elected to the Twins Hall of Fame, the club waived its two-year wait period to make Hunter eligible, and he was voted in by a landslide. He received the highest percentage of votes since Jim Kaat was elected in 2001. \"Just to be announced as a Twins Hall of Famer is a special honor,\" Hunter said. \"I'm so happy about that. Just being a part of such an elite group of guys like Rod Carew, Harmon Killebrew, Tony Oliva, Eddie Guardado and Kirby Puckett. A lot of great guys. Just for me to have my name up there with those guys is really special to me.\" Gordon was elected through a non-player committee consisting of Twins Hall of Famers, baseball historians as well as general manager Terry Ryan and team president Dave St. Peter. Hunter will be honored in a pregame ceremony on July 16, while Gordon's ceremony will be held on July 17. \"I think last year I was just frustrated, because I thought there were some people who were deserving that didn't get in, but obviously that changed and I'm happy about it,\" St. Peter said. \"Hunter was a no-brainer, and I think John Gordon -- based on what he did inside and outside the booth -- was very deserving.\" Hunter, who announced his retirement shortly after the season, was elected by a 66-person committee composed of local baseball writers, Twins Hall of Famers and front office personnel. He played 12 of his 19 years with the Twins, including last season when he returned on a one-year deal after playing five seasons with the Angels and two with the Tigers. Hunter, 40, won seven Gold Glove Awards while with the Twins and was an All-Star in 2002 and 2007. He ranks fifth on the Twins' all-time list in home runs (214), sixth in RBIs (792) and extra-base hits (521), and seventh in games (1,373), hits (1,343), doubles (281), runs (739) and total bases (2,318). Gordon, 75, spent 25 years as the club's primary play-by-play voice on radio from 1987-2011. His signature \"Touch 'Em All\" home run call helped make him a fan favorite among Twins fans. He's just the second Twins broadcaster to be elected, joining the legendary Herb Carneal. The Detroit native said he found out when Rod Carew called him on Monday with some news that caught him off guard. He was more interested in how Carew was feeling after his heart attack in September, but Carew had to cut him off and inform him that he was elected to the Twins Hall of Fame. \"I was very humbled and quite surprised,\" Gordon said. \"And as you could well imagine, I was very happy. It's indeed a great honor. I had no idea I'd ever be a candidate. Herb is the only other one. There have been a lot of great broadcasters in Twins baseball over the years. So to be in the same company as Herb is a great honor.\" Rhett Bollinger is a reporter for MLB.com. Read his blog, Bollinger Beat, follow him on Twitter @RhettBollinger and listen to his podcast.
