    "body": "LOS ANGELES -- In the credential department, new Dodgers pitching coach Rick Honeycutt lacks very little. \"There isn't a pitcher on this staff who is in a position that I haven't been in,\" said Honeycutt. \"I was a starter and a reliever. I had good years and bad. I can feel their pain.\" That's figuratively and literally, because Honeycutt also had to battle back from arm injuries during a remarkable 21-season playing career.
