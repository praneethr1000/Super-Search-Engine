    "body": "BOSTON -- While the general reaction to the return of Theo Epstein to the Red Sox was greeted with confusion and plenty of levity, the voice of the Boston fan on Wednesday was more concerned with who will be playing center field and shortstop for the team in 2006.  But as Epstein returns, the Sox were in the middle of talks aimed at landing Indians outfielder Coco Crisp as well as shortstop Alex Gonzalez. The latest report on the Crisp trade was a possible three-way deal with the Reds involved.  After the loss of Johnny Damon to the Yankees, talk radio was filled the entire next day with Damon calls and discussion. But while the return of Epstein was the No. 1 topic Wednesday, there were callers actually talking about the Bruins, who are suddenly playing well, and even whether or not the Celtics should acquire Ron Artest.
