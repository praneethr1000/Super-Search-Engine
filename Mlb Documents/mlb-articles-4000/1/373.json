    "body": "Manny Acta Sr.'s son was 13 when he got the bug, when he developed an appreciation for the game. That appreciation became a fondness, and the fondness an affection. His affection evolved into a passion, and finally, when Manny Acta Jr. was 15, the passion morphed into a fully developed obsession, almost an addiction. No matter what he was holding, his hands felt empty without a ball. When he did hold a ball, he thought he had his future in his hands. Pretty good hands they were too -- soft, skilled and reliable. What else from a young man who handled his first ground ball in San Pedro de Macoris, the Dominican city that's as much a source of shortstops as Memphis is a source of blues? Not all the members of the Acta household saw the future as young Manny did, though. And one day the senior Manny Acta pointed out the folly in his son's dream.  \"How many Dominicans are there in the NBA?\" the father asked his son.  The son's answer was \"none.\"  Next question: \"And how many are there in the big leagues?\"   \"Zillions,\" the son said.  Point made.  Like that, Manny Acta Jr. changed direction as if he were Allen Iverson. Such a crossover: from an aspiring shooting guard to shortstop wannabe in the time it takes to kick off sneakers and slip on spikes. At 6-foot-2, young Manny was \"big in my neighborhood\" but bound for a life of vertical challenges if he continued in the game he preferred. His chance was about a zillion to none. In baseball, his father reasoned, his shooter son had a better shot at reaching the heights.  \"When I didn't get signed out of my first tryout [with the White Sox], I picked up my basketball and walked right past my father,\" Manny Acta Jr. says now. A tryout with the Yankees was fruitless, as well. But he eventually signed with the Astros and began a career in baseball that has brought him to a position of international prominence. \"My father still reminds me,\" Manny Acta Jr. says. \" 'Aren't you glad I steered you away from basketball?' \"   These days, those playful reminders are directed at the manager of the Dominican Republic team in the World Baseball Classic, a team so stocked with talent, it looks like an overstuffed sandwich. The meat -- of the order -- won't fit on the bun. Years after Magic, Michael and Larry Legend formed the Dream Team in the sport that still fascinates Acta -- he intends to take in a Knicks game this week -- he will manage the WBC equivalent, a team that is likely to have no top or bottom of the batting order, only a middle.   Imagine this collection: Alfonso Soriano, Miguel Tejada, Albert Pujols, David Ortiz, Manny Ramirez, Vladimir Guerrero, Moises Alou. (Acta put them in that sequence.)   Where would A-Rod have batted if his vacillation had put him on Acta's roster? \"I respect his decision. He's American-born. And he would be proud to be connected with our team, too,\" the manager said. Who wouldn't want his incredible talent? But I don't think it is a make-or-break issue for us. We have seven players who could hit third and fourth for any big-league team.\"        \"No matter what happens, I'll never match this the rest of my life,\" Acta says. \"So many great players, so many great managers. And this is the first one. No matter what we do, nothing will match this for me.\"  Acta acknowledges he could emerge from this March tournament as a national hero or one of several if his team prevails. And if it doesn't? Involvement in an inaugural event that is all about national pride for a country fixated on baseball will be more than an ample reward. \"I'm so proud to be involved,\" he says.  \"We Dominicans are very proud of our country and our baseball, if we're not the proudest, we're probably tied for first.\"  Involvement has come as no surprise. Acta is highly regarded in his native country, his status solidified by his success with the Dominican team in the 2003-04 Caribbean World Series. That championship alone is a lasting legacy. And now this.  Still, he was the alternate choice for the position. Had Tony Pena not stepped aside to because of his job coaching with the Yankees, Acta would have been a coach with the Dominican team. He was quite comfortable with the role. \"God has a plan for all of us,\" he says.  With a sense of objectivity, Acta acknowledges the Dominican Republic rarely has distinguished itself in international competition. \"We supply talent to the big leagues,\" he says. \"This is our opportunity to prove we're as good as any team.\"  He already has sensed a singleness of purpose among his players, a willingness to subordinate their egos for the good of the team, i.e., the country. Emphasize the name on the front of the uniform -- as opposed to the ones on the back -- is what Acta expects. He believes the selfless approach can be more readily achieved in an international competition than in big-league circumstances.  Salaries -- and egos -- won't be involved in this. And with the armada of bats the Dominicans can create, who rightfully can demand to bat fourth?  \"I've known a lot of them for a long time,\" Acta says. \"I have a good relationship with the oldest guys. Some of them know me since our childhood. Moises and I played A-ball together. I have relationships from winter ball. I think I know how to handle people. I relate to them about music and what to wear. They have respect for me.\"  The leadership qualities that have led Acta to this assignment began to develop in his childhood. \"We didn't have an organized Little League,\" he says, \"I organized teams and games. Guys tell me now, 'You were always organizing something.'\"  Yet his plan was to have basketball take him as far as it could. And when his father nudged him toward baseball, the plan was refocused toward playing shortstop in the big leagues.   But Acta's baseball talent was modest. He lacked power.   He played Minor League ball with the Astros for six summers before the club, sensing his potential to teach, organize and evaluate, as well as his on-field limitations, approached him about serving as a player-coach for a Class A team that would have a large contingent of Latin players. \"I already spoke English well, and they needed a bilingual coach to work with those young players,\" he says.   The Astros later sent Acta to the MLB scouting bureau school to learn how to evaluate players. The first player evaluated was a Dominican shortstop with limited offensive potential. \"I gave myself an honest evaluation and quickly realized I didn't have the skills to play in the Major Leagues,\" Acta says. \"I didn't want to waste my time getting to where I might be a journeyman. So I focused my efforts on my new career as a coach.\"   His longer-term objective was to become a manager in the big leagues. \"I gave myself 20 years to get there,\" he says. \"I decided to work hard and see where I was after 20 years. I wanted to prepare myself. When I get the job, I don't want to just be a novelty -- the fourth Dominican manager. I want to be like Bobby Cox or Tony La Russa and do a good job for a long time.\"   Now, merely 10 years later, he has interviewed for two Major League jobs -- the Diamondbacks assignment that went to Bob Melvin last winter and the Dodgers job that went to Grady Little in December. And now he has a talent-laden Dominican team awaiting his managerial touch.   And a shooting guard does have touch.    Marty Noble is a reporter for MLB.com.
