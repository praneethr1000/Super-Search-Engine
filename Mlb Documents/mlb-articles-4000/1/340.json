    "body": "NEW YORK -- Johnny Damon will report to Tampa on Feb. 21 for his first Spring Training as a member of the New York Yankees, beginning the next chapter of his 11-year career.  As excited as Damon is to join his new team at Legends Field, the center fielder seems just as pumped up to head to Arizona in early March to represent the United States in the World Baseball Classic.  Damon is one of 52 players listed on the Team USA's preliminary roster, one which will be trimmed to 30 players five days before the United States' first game, which will take place on March 7.
