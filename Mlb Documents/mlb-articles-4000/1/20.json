    "body": "NEW YORK -- The National Baseball Hall of Fame joined forces with CITGO Petroleum Corp. on Monday to salute the impact that Latinos have had on Major League Baseball.  A subsidiary of the Venezuelan-based oil company, CITGO is spending $5 million during the next five years to underwrite a series of exhibits that will be showcased at museums and ballparks across the U.S. The first panel display is set to be unveiled at San Diego's PETCO Park on March 18-20 during the semifinals and finals of the inaugural World Baseball Classic. The larger museum exhibit will be launched this spring and traverse the country for the next year.  \"This day is long overdue,\" said Roberto Clemente Jr. at a press conference announcing the project. \"It's nearly a century in the making.\" Barry M.
