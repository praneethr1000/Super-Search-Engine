    "body": "SEATTLE (AP) -- Gil Meche agreed Thursday to a $3.7 million, one-year contract with the Mariners and avoided salary arbitration.  The 27-year-old right-hander, Seattle's last player in arbitration, was 10-8 with a 5.09 ERA in 26 starts and three relief appearances last season and made $2,535,000. He has a 44-36 career record with a 4.70 ERA.  Meche is expected to be in a rotation that includes left-handers Jarrod Washburn and Jamie Moyer, and right-handers Joel Pineiro and Felix Hernandez. Meche's contract is not guaranteed. He can make an additional $225,000 in performance bonuses: $25,000 for 190 innings, $50,000 for 200 innings and $75,000 each for 210 and 220 innings.",
