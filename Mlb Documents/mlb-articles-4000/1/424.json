    "body": "BOSTON -- Three months from playing his first home game at Fenway Park, Red Sox second baseman Mark Loretta thinks that his new office is part landmark, part movie stage.  \"It's like a museum, just driving around today, and playing there as a visitor, it's much like Wrigley Field,\" said Loretta, who was in town for Thursday's Boston Baseball Writers Dinner. \"You go there and you feel like you're on a Hollywood stage when you play there.\"  And if you liken the Red Sox to a movie, Loretta figures to be an early candidate for best supporting actor. He comes to Boston not to be a star, but to be a significant piece to an offense that still includes monster mashers David Ortiz and Manny Ramirez.   With Johnny Damon now Bronx-bound, Loretta figures to step in as a key table-setter.   Doubles hitter, meet doubles park. Loretta's style seems well suited for the comfy dimensions of fabled Fenway.   \"It should suit my game pretty well,\" said Loretta, 34. \"I'm not really a pull hitter, but I can use that wall, and right-center field is spacious, so that should help me.\"   And help the Red Sox.   \"Mark didn't know this, but we've wanted him for a long time,\" said Red Sox co-general manager Jed Hoyer. \"Mark fits our style perfectly the way he grinds out at-bats.\"   Loretta will hit second, behind a leadoff hitter to be named later.   Despite his California roots, Loretta is over the disappointment of being traded from the Padres. Though some players get intimidated by the Boston stage, Loretta seemingly can't wait to climb on board.   \"A lot of guys, actually my teammates in San Diego, we're kind of joking around, 'Now you're going to the big leagues,' just talking about the East Coast rivalry with the Yankees and all the coverage,\" said Loretta. \"It's going to be different for me. I've played on some small-market teams. I'm looking forward to a little more fanfare. I think at this stage of my career, where I've played 11 years in the big leagues now, I think it's a time when I can really appreciate it and take it in and handle it.\"   While most baseball players across the country arrive to work roughly four hours before game time with little fanfare, Red Sox fans crowd the parking lot and gawk at all the players upon arrival on a daily basis.   Did Loretta experience a similar scene in San Diego?   \"Yeah, there were two: Frank and Bart, I know them by name,\" quipped Loretta. \"I've heard about it. Even as a visiting player, coming to the ballpark and noticing how many people were around, it's a different deal.   \"Any time you can play in front of a sold-out crowd, it always gives you a lift. ... I played some games in County Stadium where there were about 6,000 people in a 60,000-seat stadium, and you can hear every single voice and every single guy yelling at you. When it's sold out and there's just more of that buzz in the air, it kind of energizes you.\"   Before a thumb injury greatly hindered Loretta's 2005 season, Loretta was on the rise as one of the best offensive second basemen in the game. In 2004, he had a monster season, hitting .335, scored 108 runs, smacked 208 hits, belted 47 doubles, hit 16 homers and had a .391 on-base percentage.   If he can even come close to those numbers, the Red Sox will have a player who makes a big difference in the lineup.   \"I feel great, the thumb feels good,\" Loretta said. \"It was the second time I had hurt that thumb and had surgery on it. Having the last couple of months last year to kind of do some baseball-related things after the surgery helped, and now I've had a great offseason, good workouts and I'm ready to go.\" Ian Browne is a reporter for MLB.com.
