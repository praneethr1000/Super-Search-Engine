    "body": "Team Canada won't have a Barry Bonds, Manny Ramirez, Johan Santana or Ichiro Suzuki to lean on during the inaugural World Baseball Classic.  And unlike their hockey counterparts at the Turin Winter Olympics, the Canadians certainly won't be prohibitive favorites during baseball's marquee international tournament.  However, the underdog Team Canada will field a talented group that just might surprise some baseball pundits when WBC action begins on March 3. Canada will open its tournament play against South Africa on March 7, followed by the U.S. on March 8 and Mexico on March 9. The Pool B games will be played at Chase Field, home of the Arizona Diamondbacks, and Scottsdale Stadium, Spring Training home of the San Francisco Giants.       Ed Eagle is a reporter for MLB.com.
