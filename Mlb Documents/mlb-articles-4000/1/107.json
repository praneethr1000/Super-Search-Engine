    "body": "PORT ST. LUCIE, Fla. -- The Mets' future met up with a major piece of its past Monday as Darryl Strawberry paid an unexpected visit to the club's January minicamp.  The Mets' all-time home run leader, Strawberry spent last season as a roving advisor in the organization, serving as an unofficial coach during Spring Training and visiting farm clubs throughout the organization.  \"With my history of things I've experienced in life, I have a great gift to elaborate to the kids about the mistakes I made,\" Strawberry said. Still an imposing figure at 43, Strawberry commands interest and attention -- even in a Minor League clubhouse filled with players who were in grade school when Strawberry took his last swings for the Mets in 1990.   \"He was definitely one of my childhood heroes growing up,\" said David Wright. \"Now, being able to hold a conversation with him and talk to him about what it was like playing for the Mets in the '80s, it's a special thing.\"   Though Strawberry will still likely be asked a decade from now to regale people with behind-the-scenes stories of how the Mets ruled New York in 1986, the former slugger considers his life message more important.   Strawberry visited with all three of the Mets' Class A farm clubs last year, talking with Minor Leaguers on the St. Lucie, Hagerstown and Brooklyn rosters.   Among the former slugger's messages, told through his own experiences: avoiding temptations and making correct decisions, both on and off the field.   \"I'm at a very good place in my life,\" Strawberry said. \"I don't want people to remember me as a baseball player. I hope they remember how I overcame the trials and tribulations of life, and was able to save young kids. That's what's really important.\"   \"[Strawberry's] not a doctor, he's not a psychiatrist,\" Wright said. \"He's experienced what we're going through and he knows all about it. Hearing it come from his mouth means a lot more.\"   Classically trained: With the inaugural World Baseball Classic looming around the corner, the Mets -- like most clubs -- aren't quite sure how the tournament will affect their Spring Training routines.   Players figure to be coming and going from the Mets' complex throughout the spring, although that won't be different from the rest of the teams.   \"We don't know [what it will affect] because it's the first time,\" Mets general manager Omar Minaya said. \"I'm one of those who chooses to be positive about [the] World Baseball [Classic]. Like anything else, it's something that's probably good for baseball in the big picture, and we have to give it a chance.\"   Minaya and Mets manager Willie Randolph said there was no new information to report regarding ace right-hander Pedro Martinez's injured toe, which has threatened to keep him out of competition for the Dominican Republic.   \"It's a hard question to answer,\" Randolph said. \"I know Pedro is in great shape and he knows his body.\"   Camping out: The Mets' minicamp in Port St. Lucie will run through Wednesday and featured mostly light workouts on the first day, with players running sprints, throwing and hitting.   An optional event for players on the 40-man roster (but mandatory for invited Minor Leaguers not on the roster), Minaya said the camp serves more as a checkup for players with health concerns over the winter.   The minicamp yielded familiar faces from last year's Major League clubhouse. Wright, Heath Bell and Royce Ring are among those in attendance, as well as Triple-A hopefuls like Brian Bannister, Jeff Keppinger and Angel Pagan.   \"It's good to get outside and run around in the sun,\" Wright said. \"This gets you completely focused on Spring Training -- smelling the locker room and getting on the field. It's a different feeling getting outdoors.\" Bryan Hoch is a contributor to MLB.com. This story was not subject to the approval of Major League Baseball or its clubs.",
