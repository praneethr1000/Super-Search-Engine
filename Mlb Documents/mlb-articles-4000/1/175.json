    "body": "At some point, having more wins than anyone not in baseball's Hall of Fame loses its distinction and becomes just a festering frustration.  Tommy John, winner of 288 games, reached that point a long time ago. He is on the Hall of Fame ballot for the 12th time, and still appears a better bet to make the American Medical Association's Hall of Fame than baseball's.  As a pitcher, consistency was his chief asset. He won 13-plus games 11 times, with an amazing 22 seasons spanning the first (1965) and last (1987). \"I have no control over it. I don't really worry about things I can't control. Let it fall where it may,\" he told MLB.com a year ago.           To John, it was a matter of still being able to pitch at a high level and still being asked to do so. He didn't pitch out the string in Detroit or Pittsburgh or some other doormat of the times, but in the Bronx, in his last four seasons, going 29-24 for the Yankees.
