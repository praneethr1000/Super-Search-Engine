    "body": "LOS ANGELES -- The Dodgers have agreed to a six-year, $30 million contract with Cuban pitcher Yaisel Sierra, sources told MLB.com's Jesse Sanchez. The club, however, has not confirmed the deal, which was first reported by Yahoo! Sports and is pending a physical. The Marlins and Cubs were also among the teams to show a strong interest in Sierra. Because of his age and experience, the right-handed Sierra, 24, is not subject to MLB's international signing guidelines and the financial restrictions imposed on clubs like the Dodgers who have spent lavishly on international players in the past year. He left Cuba last April, and he was declared a free agent late last month. • Hot Stove Tracker Sierra, who is listed at 6-foot-1 and 168 pounds, pitched for four seasons in the Cuban League, where he went 16-21 with a 4.23 ERA and a 1.490 WHIP, primarily as a starter. With the current depth in the Dodgers' starting rotation, it's conceivable he could compete for a relief role as soon as this spring. In an attempt to play catch-up after being dormant in the international market for years, the Dodgers have been particularly aggressive in the Cuban market since they overwhelmed Yasiel Puig in 2012 with a seven-year, $42 million deal. Puig was an immediate sensation, prompting the club to scoop up infielders Alex Guerrero ($28 million), Erisbel Arruebarrena ($25 million) and Hector Olivera ($62.5 million), with mixed results. • Top 30 International Prospects list That hasn't stopped them in the past few months from signing Cuban pitcher Yadier Alvarez and fellow Cuban prospects Yusniel Diaz and Omar Estevez.
