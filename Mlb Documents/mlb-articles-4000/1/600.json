    "body": "The Yankees and right-hander Nathan Eovaldi have agreed to a one-year, non-guaranteed contract to avoid arbitration. Terms of the deal were not disclosed, though multiple reports put the figure at $5.6 million. â€¢ Hot Stove Tracker Eovaldi, who turns 26 in February, was 14-3 with a 4.20 ERA in 27 starts for the Yankees in 2015, his first year in the Bronx. This marks his second time being arbitration-eligible, and he can become a free agent following the 2017 season. Eovaldi owns a 29-38 career record and 4.10 ERA in 110 career appearances (106 starts) in five seasons with the Dodgers, Marlins and Yankees. Cash Kruth is a reporter for MLB.com.
