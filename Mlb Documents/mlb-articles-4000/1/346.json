    "body": "Frank Thomas spent 16 seasons rewriting the Chicago White Sox record books. He will now have a chance to write at least a few chapters for the A's.  Oakland on Wednesday afternoon announced a one-year agreement with the 37-year-old slugger, hoping he can still put a Big Hurt on the rest of the American League.  If this is a shared risk, most of it is being borne by Thomas. Coming off two seasons marred by fractures to his left ankle, he agreed to a classic incentive-laden make-good contract. \"When Frank is healthy, he is a huge right-handed presence,\" Beane said. \"And that's been a big issue for us the last couple of years.\"                Tom Singer is a reporter for MLB.com.
