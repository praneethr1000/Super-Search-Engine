    "body": "SAN FRANCISCO -- One skill Jeremy Affeldt and Bob Howry won't have to refine in Spring Training is their timing. The pair of relievers forged contract agreements with the Giants shortly after the free-agent signing period began last Nov. 14, and they didn't know how lucky they were. More than 90 free agents remain unsigned, including about 20 fellow proven relievers. They received lucrative deals, but now they look doubly smart -- being handsomely paid and employed -- as the nation's struggling economy affects how ballclubs do business. \"I was very fortunate to get an aggressive offer,\" said Affeldt, who signed a two-year, $8 million deal. Meanwhile, quality left-handed relievers such as Joe Beimel, Dennys Reyes and Will Ohman have yet to find teams, as was the case with Affeldt last year at this time.
