    "body": "CHICAGO -- It's the first day of the Cubs Convention, and 15,000 fans are packed into the Hilton Chicago with questions. The team will open the 2006 season in about 12 weeks. Does Cubs manager Dusty Baker know who will bat second in his lineup?  \"I don't know yet,\" Baker said on Friday. \"It's probably [Todd] Walker -- if Walker's playing.\"  Which prompts another question -- is Walker still the Cubs starting second baseman? The left-handed hitting infielder is the best hitter among the three second baseman on the roster, but would trail Neifi Perez and Jerry Hairston Jr. if the trio was ranked by its defensive skills.
