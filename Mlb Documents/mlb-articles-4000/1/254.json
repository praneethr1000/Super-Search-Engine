    "body": "NEW YORK -- The Mets announced Tuesday they had signed three players with Major League experience and invited them to Spring Training and invited an additional nine players to attend camp. The Mets signed catcher Bobby Estalella, who was out of baseball last year after spending Spring Training with Cincinnati. Estalella, 31, spent 2004 with Arizona and Toronto, batting a combined .185 (5-for-27) with two home runs and four RBIs in 12 games. Right-hander Jose Santiago, 31, who appeared in four games with the Mets last season, was also signed. He had a 3.18 ERA in 5 2\/3 innings. He pitched in 28 games, including 17 starts, with Triple-A Norfolk, posting a 7-6 record with a 4.26 ERA in 122 2\/3 innings. Also signed was right-hander Jeremi Gonzalez, a veteran who spent last season in the Boston organization. He was on the Major League roster from May 2-25 and from July 4 to the end of the season. In 25 relief appearances, the 31-year-old Gonzalez was 1-0 with a 5.57 ERA, and he was 1-1 with a 7.71 ERA in three starts covering 14 innings.  Non-roster players invited to camp include right-handed pitchers Rafael Cova, Tim Lavigne and Jason Scobie; catchers Drew Butera, Zac Clements, Aaron Hathaway and Andy Wilson; infielder Brett Harper and top outfield prospect Lastings Milledge.  The team so far has invited 27 non-roster players to its training camp, including 12 pitchers, eight catchers, three infielders and four outfielders.     Front-office moves: On a busy day, the Mets also made several front-office appointments.  Bryan Lambe and Scott Nethery were named special assistants to general manager Omar Minaya. Adam Wogan was hired to become director of Minor League operations. Kevin Morgan, who formerly held the post now occupied by Wogan, was named coordinator of instruction for the Minor Leagues.  Lambe joined the organization last year as coordinator of professional scouting after spending 2000-2005 as assistant to the general manger of the Arizona Diamondbacks.   Nethery was hired by the Mets as a special assignment and professional scout after spending 1991-2004 with the Atlanta Braves.  Wogan spent the previous eight years with the Expos in Montreal and the Nationals in Washington.  Kit Stier is a contributor to MLB.com.
