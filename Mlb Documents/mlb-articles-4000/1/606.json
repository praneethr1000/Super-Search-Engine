    "body": "ARLINGTON -- Rangers pitcher Yu Darvish issued a statement through his representatives about Major League Baseball's investigation into his brother Sho Darvish's alleged gambling activities. \"I am not and have never been involved with gambling activities,\" Darvish said through the Wasserman Media Group. \"While I understand that Major League Baseball must conduct an investigation, I am certain that they will find that I had no involvement in this matter whatsoever. I will not comment on this matter again out of respect for Major League Baseball's investigation and I am focused on preparing for the upcoming season.\" According to the Japan Times, Major League Baseball is investigating any link between Darvish and his brother's arrest in October, though the Rangers right-hander has not been accused of any wrongdoing at this point. The newspaper said Sho Darvish's arrest was announced by Osaka police on Oct. 27 after an investigation of more than one year. He was charged by the Osaka District Public Prosecutor's Office in mid-November with gambling and running a betting ring. \"We are aware of this situation and are looking into it, per our standard protocols,\" MLB's vice president of communications Michael Teevan told the Japan Times.
