    "body": "ANAHEIM -- The Angels came to terms Wednesday with right-handed reliever Brendan Donnelly on a one-year, $950,000 contract as both sides avoided arbitration.  Donnelly, who made $420,000 last season, submitted a $1.05 million proposal Tuesday, the deadline to exchange arbitration figures. The Angels countered with $850,000.  With Donnelly under contract, the Angels have now signed all seven of their arbitration-eligible players to new deals. Chone Figgins, Jose Molina and Juan Rivera all signed multiyear contracts, while John Lackey, Francisco Rodriguez and Scot Shields, like Donnelly, signed one-year contracts. The 34-year-old Donnelly posted a 9-3 record and a 3.72 ERA last season in 65 appearances, establishing career highs in wins and games pitched. He retired 43 of first batters that he faced, but also served an eight-day suspension for having an illegal substance on his glove.   On June 14, Nationals manager Frank Robinson requested that Donnelly's glove be inspected by umpires for a foreign substance. It was later determined to be pine tar and Donnelly was initially suspended 10 days, which was reduced on appeal.   The Washington, D.C., native was originally selected by the Chicago White Sox in the 27th round of the 1992 draft and was signed by the Angels as a Minor League free agent on Jan. 20, 2001.   Prior to joining the Angels, Donnelly spent 10 years in the Minors with nine organizations, including a pair of independent teams, before getting his break in 2002. Donnelly was recalled and optioned three times by the Angels that year, but he hung on to go 1-1 with a 2.17 ERA in 46 regular-season appearances with the big club.   Donnelly led Angels pitchers with five World Series appearances against the Giants in 2002 and earned the victory in the Angels' comeback win in Game 6. He did not allow a run in 7 2\/3 innings.      Donnelly went 2-2 with a 1.58 ERA in 63 appearances in 2003 and 5-2 with a 3.00 ERA in 40 relief appearances in 2004 after missing the first 64 games of the year because of injuries he suffered from being hit in the face by a ball in batting practice that spring.
