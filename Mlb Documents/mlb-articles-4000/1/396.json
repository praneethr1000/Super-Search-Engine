    "body": "NEW YORK -- After several months of uncertainty, Alex Rodriguez has decided that he will participate in the World Baseball Classic, and that he will do so wearing a Team USA uniform. The WBC saga of the reigning American League MVP came to a somewhat surprising conclusion on Tuesday night, as Rodriguez announced on his Web site that he would represent the U.S. in the inaugural tournament. \"Following discussion with my family and agent, the Commissioner, and the Major League Baseball Players Association, I have decided to participate in the World Baseball Classic,\" Rodriguez said in a statement on AROD.com. \"In recent weeks, following dialogue with caring friends and players, both Dominican and American, I reached the conclusion that if I played in the Classic, I would play for the United States and honor my American citizenship. \"I appreciate the support and understanding of my fellow Dominican players and friends who aided me in making this decision,\" he added. \"The World Baseball Classic offers baseball and its fans an exciting new forum and I look forward, if selected, to representing the United States in what will be baseball's greatest international competition.\"  In mid-December, Rodriguez said that he was leaning toward representing the Dominican Republic, which would have been his right because of his parents' citizenship in that country. Just days later, he changed his mind, saying that he would skip the event altogether as not to offend either the Dominican Republic or the U.S.   MLB and union officials lobbied the Yankees' third baseman over the past few weeks, trying to convince him to play in the event.  Earlier in the day on Tuesday, it appeared that Rodriguez would stand by his plan to sit out the tournament, even though the Dominican Republic had placed him on its provisional roster on Monday.  USA Baseball was prepared to leave A-Rod off its roster, as union officials informed the U.S. that Rodriguez planned to skip the WBC. But as the day went on, Rodriguez changed his mind, ultimately deciding to represent his home country along with teammates Derek Jeter, Johnny Damon and Al Leiter.  Rodriguez is one of 52 players on Team USA's provisional roster, a list that includes four other third basemen: Eric Chavez, Morgan Ensberg, Chipper Jones and David Wright.  \"He's one of the best players in the game,\" said Paul Seiler, USA Baseball's executive director and chief executive, of Rodriguez. \"We'll be thrilled to have him on our team.\"    Mark Feinsand is a reporter for MLB.com.
