    "body": "LOUISVILLE, Ky. -- As Spring Training gets closer, the less likely it seems that the Reds will make any further additions or subtractions during what's left of the offseason. At the same time, transactions remain possible, especially with several free agents still available. The Reds made an unsuccessful run at free-agent pitcher Bronson Arroyo, who was interested in returning to his former team. Arroyo received a better offer from the Nationals and signed a Minor League contract on Tuesday. â€¢ Reds Caravan schedule Cincinnati had wanted the veteran Arroyo to help mentor its young rotation. \"There are still a handful of guys out there that might make sense to bring into camp with a similar profile as Bronson. Just veteran guys, but not high-profile, big-dollar guys,\" Reds general manager Dick Williams said Thursday before the start of a team caravan stop at Louisville Slugger Field. \"I wouldn't be surprised if we add maybe a little bit to our depth there.\"  Autograph time! pic.twitter.com\/K4qqToVb8m Any addition would likely come via a Minor League deal. Williams, and president of baseball operations Walt Jocketty, spent much of the offseason exploring trades of veteran Reds players as the club works to rebuild with younger talent. Deals were completed for Todd Frazier and Aroldis Chapman. An attempt to trade Brandon Phillips to Washington was not approved when the second baseman did not waive his no-trade rights. Right fielder Jay Bruce has also been available. \"You're still seeing trades happen, and there is always that possibility,\" Williams said. \"We're still talking to other organizations. I wouldn't say anything is imminent. In our situation, we take the approach of remaining open and keeping as much dialogue going with other teams. \"You never know when the right fit is going to present itself, but I don't see us making any major signings. I think we're done in that department. We certainly have the numbers we need for camp.\" Mark Sheldon is a reporter for MLB.com.
