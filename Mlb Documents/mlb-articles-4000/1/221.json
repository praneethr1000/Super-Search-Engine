    "body": "OAKLAND -- The October 2005 passing of legendary radio play-by-play man Bill King left a gaping hole in the soul of A's fans who considered King part of the family, and that hole will never be filled.  Vince Cotroneo, however, will help fill the Oakland airwaves in King's absence, agreeing this week to a two-year contract to broadcast games over the A's Radio Network through the 2007 season. The deal was announced Friday.  Prior to joining the A's, Cotroneo spent six seasons (1998-2003) as an announcer on Texas Rangers broadcasts, where he partnered with Eric Nadel on the Rangers Radio Network. Cotroneo joined the Rangers broadcast team in 1998 after spending seven seasons (1991-97) with the Houston Astros, where he handled color analysis on road radio games and Fox Sports Southwest television. \"Vince brings 13 years of Major League experience to the booth, and I'm confident his style will blend nicely with the talents of Ken Korach and Ray Fosse to form one of the top announcing teams in baseball,\" said A's vice president of broadcasting\/communications Ken Pries.   Korach, who assumes King's No. 1 spot in the radio booth, was part of the three-month search for his new partner.   \"Ken was amazingly thorough in making this decision, and that's why it took so long,\" Korach said Friday from Las Vegas, where he makes his offseason home. \"He sent me about 12 or 15 tapes of some of the guys he was interested in, and I got to listen to those and give some feedback. And when it got down to the final few guys, they flew me to Oakland to sit in on some of the interviews.   \"I wasn't there for Vince's interview, but I've known Vince for a number of years, and I think he's a fantastic choice.\"   Cotroneo began his career with the Class A Lynchburg Mets in 1984. He spent the next three seasons with the Double-A El Paso Diablos in the Milwaukee system before moving onto the Triple-A Iowa Cubs for the 1988 season. In his only season with Iowa, he was selected as the National Association's Minor League Announcer of the Year.   Cotroneo joined the Astros organization the following season and was the radio voice of the Tucson Toros for two seasons (1989-90) before landing his first big-league job with the Astros in 1991. It was while Cotroneo was in Tucson that he first crossed paths with Korach, who was calling games for the San Diego Padres' Triple-A club in Las Vegas at the time.   \"We were in the Pacific Coast League at the same time, and, of course, we'd see each other several times a year over the past six years that he was with the Rangers,\" Korach said. \"So I'm very familiar with Vince, and the main thing for me is that he's a really good guy who's going to bust his butt.   \"This is such a subjective business, you know, so some people are going to like your voice or what you say, and some people aren't. But the one thing you can control is how much work you put into it, and Vince is extremely diligent, so that was part of the attraction for me.   \"I also know he got a glowing recommendation from his partner in Texas, Eric Nadel, and I think that carried quite a bit of weight in this, too.\"   The A's also announced Friday that Glen Kuiper and Tim Roye will return to the team's Fox Sports Bay Area and KICU Action 36\/Cable 6 telecasts this season. One of the finalists for the job that went to Cotroneo, Steve Bitker, likely will remain in his role of recent years as a radio fill-in.   \"Steve was right in it until the very end,\" Korach said. \"As good as I feel for Vince, I feel disappointed for Steve.\"  Mychael Urban is a national writer for MLB.com.
