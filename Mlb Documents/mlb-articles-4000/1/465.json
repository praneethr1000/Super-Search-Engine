    "body": "Packing a Hall of Fame bat along with some well-worn tools of intelligence, Mike Piazza is returning to Southern California, where it all began.  In yet another move to enhance its chances to successfully defend their National League West title, the Padres and 12-time All-Star catcher Mike Piazza agreed on Sunday to a one-year, $2 million contract.  Piazza, 37, made his reputation with the Dodgers before they shocked their fans by trading Tommy Lasorda's godson to the Florida Marlins in 1998. Soon Piazza was on his way to Broadway, starring for the New York Mets while continuing to rack up tremendous offensive numbers. Lyle Spencer is a reporter for MLB.com.
