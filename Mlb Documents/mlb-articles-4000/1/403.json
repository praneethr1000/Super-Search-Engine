    "body": "PHILADELPHIA -- The Phillies agreed to a one-year, $1.5 million contract on Monday with reserve outfielder Jason Michaels.  Michaels, who was Philadelphia's last remaining arbitration-eligible player, received a significant raise from the $825,000 he earned a year ago.  Last week, the club avoided arbitration with Brett Myers by inking the right-hander to a one-year, $3.3 million pact. In December, the Phillies and Aaron Fultz bypassed the process also by coming to terms on a one-year, $1.2 million deal. If the Phillies and Michaels hadn't reached a deal by noon ET on Tuesday, the two sides would have exchanged salary figures and an arbitration hearing would have have taken place between Feb. 1 and Feb. 20 if the two sides still had not agreed on a deal.   Michaels hit .304 with four home runs and 31 RBIs in 289 at-bats while scoring a career-high 54 runs last season.   Michaels, who is expected to be the team's fourth outfielder this season, can also earn $25,000 each in bonuses for reaching 375 and 450 plate appearances.   \"We believe Jason can be a key player off the bench and someone who can step in and start from time to time,\" Phillies general manager Pat Gillick said recently. \"We feel confident he'll be able to help us a lot this season.\"  Andy Jasner is a contributor to MLB.com.
