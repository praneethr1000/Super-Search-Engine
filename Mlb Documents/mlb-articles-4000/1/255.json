    "body": "LOS ANGELES -- Catcher Pat Borders and left-handed reliever Joe Beimel are the latest non-roster players signed by the Dodgers and invited to Major League training camp.  Borders will be 43 in May and he made his Major League debut in 1988, the last year the Dodgers won the World Series. Speaking of which, Borders was the World Series MVP in 1992 with his original club, the Toronto Blue Jays. He also appeared in the 1993 World Series with Toronto and has five postseason appearances.  Borders has played in the Major Leagues during 17 different seasons, and the Dodgers will be his 12th organization. He started the 2005 season with Milwaukee's Triple-A affiliate in Nashville and was traded to Seattle on May 20. He appeared in 39 games with the Mariners, hitting .197 with one homer and seven RBIs, and was cut loose at the end of July. Borders figures to back up top catching prospect Russell Martin at Triple-A Las Vegas, where another catcher and World Series tri-MVP, Steve Yeager, is the new hitting coach.   Beimel, 29 in April, appeared in seven games for Tampa Bay last year with a 3.27 ERA, but spent his first six professional seasons with Pittsburgh, where current Dodgers vice president of scouting and player development Roy Smith was assistant general manager.   Beimel played most of the last two seasons at Triple-A. Ken Gurnick is a reporter for MLB.com. This story was not subject to the approval of Major League Baseball or its clubs.",
