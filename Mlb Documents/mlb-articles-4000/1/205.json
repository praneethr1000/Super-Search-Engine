    "body": "The suspense that gripped the most recent Hall of Fame balloting won't be evident when the Baseball Writers Association of America holds its 64th election in 2007.  Rather than mystery, there will only be undisputed mastery a year from now.  Suspense had hovered over whether baseball writers would elect anyone off what was generally viewed as a lukewarm 2006 slate. When pioneer closer Bruce Sutter got Tuesday's nod, the suspense became under whose cap would he be enshrined into Cooperstown on July 30: Cubs or Cardinals? While there is no such thing as a \"down\" year for the Hall of Fame, Petroskey has reveled in the buildup to 2007. He became the Hall's fifth president mere days before Induction Day 1999, a memorable afternoon on which George Brett and Robin Yount (the only prior 3,000-hit tandem) and Nolan Ryan were enshrined in front of an overflow crowd of 50,000 fans.
