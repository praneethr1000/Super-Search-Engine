    "body": "Just a few hours before a deadline, the Reds re-signed free agent infielder Rich Aurilia on Sunday to a one-year, $1.3 million contract with a $2 million mutual option for the 2007 season.  Because Aurilia declined the Reds' arbitration offer last month, the club would not have been able to re-sign him again until May 1 if the two sides hadn't reached an agreement before midnight.  \"This turned out to be a longer exercise than we envisioned,\" said Reds general manager Dan O'Brien about the contract talks. \"The fact we successfully concluded it is what matters.\" Mark Sheldon is a reporter for MLB.com.
