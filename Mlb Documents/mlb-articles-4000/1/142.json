    "body": "PITTSBURGH -- The Pittsburgh Pirates announced Tuesday night that they had come to terms with pitcher Ryan Vogelsong and outfielder Jody Gerut on one-year deals, thus avoiding arbitration with both players.  Terms of the two deals were not disclosed.  Vogelsong, 28, pitched well out of the bullpen last season after struggling in previous years as a starter. The right-hander was 2-2 with a 4.43 ERA in a career-high 44 relief appearances. Ed Eagle is a reporter for MLB.com.
