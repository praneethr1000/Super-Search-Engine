    "body": "The Astros' acquisition of Preston Wilson was a good thing. But the contract they gave him was better than good. It was a role model for motivation.  The contract that the Astros and the outfielder agreed upon should net Wilson about $4 million for 2006. After that there is a three-year club option that would get Wilson between $8 and $9 million per year depending on whether certain incentives are met. The club buyout of the option is $500,000, so if this acquisition doesn't work out, the Astros would be out no more than $4.5 million. In today's market for slugging outfielders, this is clearly in the bargain basement level. But if Wilson delivers for the Astros in 2006, he will come into some serious money, which, presumably, he will deserve.  It's a something-for-everyone deal, which also puts a real premium on Preston Wilson's work next season. You would like to see more baseball contracts based on something like this, something like real performance, or, in other words, something like reality. Beyond that, this acquisition makes sense for the Astros, based on their needs and Wilson's abilities. It is true that they will have an apparent surplus of outfielders -- Lance Berkman, Willy Taveras, Jason Lane, not to mention Chris Burke at least part of the time, and now Wilson. But if Jeff Bagwell's return from shoulder surgery doesn't go as well as hoped, Berkman would move to first and the surplus would be reduced.   Plus, there is the matter of scoring runs. When we last saw the Astros this is what they were not doing. They had staged a magnificent run from way off the pace in the National League Central, to the Wild Card berth, through the Division Series and the Championship Series, all the way to the World Series.   Once at this pinnacle, however, they could not score runs, at least against the Chicago White Sox. They hit .203 and were swept by the Sox. Some of their supporters suggested that the Astros' game was thrown off because Major League Baseball insisted that the Minute Maid Park roof be kept open in the pleasant Houston climate of October. Maybe, but a more traditional, less complicated view would be that the Chicago pitchers, at least for these four nights, were significantly better than the Houston hitters.   The Astros, based on these results, needed to obtain at least one more hitter with pop. They just did. You know three things for sure about Preston Wilson, based on all the available evidence: He can hit for power. He will cover ground in the outfield. He will strike out a lot.   Two out of three is not bad. In 2003, Wilson hit 36 home runs and led the National League in RBIs with 141. Admittedly, he was then in the employ of the Colorado Rockies, playing his home games in a hitter-friendly park. In 2005, traded from the Rockies to the Washington Nationals, he hit 25 home runs with 90 RBIs. On the other hand, in Washington, he was playing in a truly pitcher-friendly facility.   On the Astros side of the argument, Wilson is 31 and should not yet be in decline due to advanced age. And Minute Maid Park, while it is certainly not located at high altitude, is much more reminiscent of Coors Field than it is of RFK Stadium, particularly for a right-handed hitter.   And, of course, Wilson will have all the incentives in the world to have a huge 2006. The carrot of those three seasons at $8-9 million per year will be there before him.   The Astros ought to be congratulated twice; for finding a player that fits their needs and for formulating a contract offer that takes into account today's inflationary market prices, yet makes fiscal sense.   The worst thing that could happen to them here is that Wilson could have a big 2006, the club would then exercise its option and he would then get injured, become completely ineffective or otherwise fall off the face of the Earth. But he still would have had that great 2006, so there is no way this scenario could be a total loss.   Perhaps the best thing that could happen for the 2006 Houston Astros would still be the May return of Roger Clemens. But in the meantime, the Astros have made a move that makes all sorts of sense; from the standpoint of need, from the standpoint of finances and from the standpoint of offering loads of motivation to their newest acquisition.
