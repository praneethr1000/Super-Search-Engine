    "body": "BOSTON -- The Red Sox on Wednesday remained quiet about any rumored trade to bring Coco Crisp to Boston.  Less than 24 hours after right-handed reliever Guillermo Mota reportedly failed a physical in Cleveland -- undergone because of concerns about his right shoulder -- reports surfaced in Cincinnati and Cleveland that the Reds were interested in revisiting a proposed three-team deal that would send Matt Clement to the Reds and Reds outfielder Austin Kearns to Cleveland.  So instead of a straight two-team exchange between Boston and Cleveland, a three-team exchange between the Reds, Red Sox and Indians became more likely on Wednesday when news leaked of the condition of Mota's right arm and shoulder. Earlier on Tuesday, an official with inside knowledge of the talks confirmed to MLB.com that such a failure would likely nix the deal between Cleveland and Boston, because the Indians wanted Mota in the deal along with Red Sox third base prospect Andy Marte and catcher Kelly Shoppach in return for Crisp, reliever David Riske and catcher Josh Bard.   \"You'll probably understand if we offer a polite 'no comment,' \" Red Sox general manager Theo Epstein said on Wednesday, referring to Boston's new policy on commenting about personnel moves that aren't final.   Sources also told MLB.com that the Red Sox were considering replacing Mota with 23-year-old right-handed reliever Manny Delcarmen, but it was unclear whether the Indians would find that acceptable.   For Cincinnati, the news provided a second chance at acquiring a top-of-the-rotation starter in Clement after former GM Dan O'Brien reportedly nixed the deal last week, one of his final decisions before being dismissed by new Reds owner Bob Castellini.   Crisp, the key figure in any proposed deal for the Red Sox, is a switch-hitter who played primarily left field for the Indians last season because of the emergence of Grady Sizemore in center. Crisp batted .300 in 2005 with 16 homers and 69 RBIs while swiping 15 bases, all career highs. In addition to patrolling center, he would enter Spring Training as a leading candidate to fill Johnny Damon's role as the club's new regular leadoff hitter.
