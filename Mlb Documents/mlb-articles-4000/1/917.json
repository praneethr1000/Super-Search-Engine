    "body": "SEATTLE -- Mariners catcher Jesus Sucre will be sidelined for at least the next six months after undergoing surgery earlier this week to repair a broken fibula and severely sprained right ankle, trainer Rick Griffin said on Thursday. Sucre injured his leg sliding into second base during a Venezuelan League game about 10 days ago. He flew to Seattle this week so Mariners team physician Dr. Ed Khalfayan could perform the surgery. The 27-year-old Sucre hit .157 in 127 at-bats over 50 games for Seattle last year and figured to be fourth on the depth chart behind newly acquired veterans Chris Iannetta and Steve Clevenger, along with former first-round Draft pick Mike Zunino, prior to his injury. Sucre is the only player dealing with significant injury issues heading into Spring Training. Griffin said Robinson Cano, who had double hernia surgery in October, is fully recovered and won't have any limitations when camp opens next month in Peoria, Ariz. In other health updates from Griffin: • Left-handed reliever Charlie Furbush, who spent the final three months of the 2015 season on the disabled list with tendinitis in his shoulder, has begun his offseason throwing program without feeling any discomfort. Furbush will likely be brought along slowly in Spring Training, but he is currently long-tossing up to 90 feet. He won't throw any bullpen sessions until after getting to Arizona in mid-February. • Left-hander James Paxton has had an excellent offseason and is completely recovered from the fingernail issues that arose after he returned from the disabled list with shoulder issues much of last season. \"He's been throwing and feels great,\" Griffin said. \"He's lost 20 pounds and is very much more athletic and moving better. His finger is fine, his lat is fine. He's in a really good place and position to come to Spring Training and compete, and hopefully have a really good year for us.\" • There are no concerns with right-hander Hisashi Iwakuma, despite a failed physical by the Dodgers that led to him returning to the Mariners. \"I'm 100 percent comfortable and have no concerns and neither does our orthopedists and physicians or we wouldn't have got him back,\" Griffin said. \"I don't know what happened there. I have no idea and I'm not going to speculate. But I'm glad he's back here and I know he's glad. We know his body and know him very well and what we need to do to keep him on the field.\" • Franklin Gutierrez, who has dealt with the nerve condition ankylosing spondylitis for the last few years, has had a very good offseason and his weight is stable at about 215 pounds. But Griffin said his illness remains an issue that needs to be monitored. \"He's very honest and will work with [manager Scott Servais] and me and let us know how he feels,\" Griffin said. \"There'll be days he can't play and we know that. And there'll be days when he feels great, so we'll try to take advantage of those days.\" Greg Johns is a reporter for MLB.com.
