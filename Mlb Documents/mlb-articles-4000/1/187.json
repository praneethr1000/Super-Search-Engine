    "body": "NEW YORK -- Miguel Cairo has crossed boroughs back to the Bronx, the Yankees announced Thursday.  After spending last season across the Triboro Bridge in Queens with the Mets, the 31-year-old infielder agreed to terms on a one-year, $1 million contract to return to the Yankees, for whom he played 122 games in 2004.  Following that season, Cairo had expressed a desire to remain with the Yankees, and the team seemed mutually responsive. An apparent misunderstanding halted negotiations, and the Yankees wound up signing Tony Womack instead. Womack was replaced by Robinson Cano in May and was traded to the Cincinnati Reds during the Winter Meetings in December.   \"I knew the Yankees wanted me to stay,\" Cairo said last year. \"They wanted to sign me, but it didn't work out. ... I was very disappointed. I know that I talked to [Yankees GM] Brian Cashman and they really wanted to sign me.\"   With the Mets, Cairo served as one of manager Willie Randolph's primary reserves, backing up Kaz Matsui at second base and playing 82 games at the position.   Cairo batted .251 with two home runs and 19 RBIs in 100 total games for the Mets, also seeing time at third base and in the outfield.   He has played for six teams in his career, also having performed for Toronto, the Cubs, Tampa Bay and St. Louis. Cairo will serve as the Yankees' utility infielder, backing up Cano, Derek Jeter and Alex Rodriguez.   The Yankees also agreed Thursday to a minor league contract with reliever Ramiro Mendoza, who made it into one game with the team last September following January shoulder surgery.   A 33-year-old right-hander, Mendoza pitched with the Yankees from 1996 through 2002 before spending two years with the Red Sox. In 342 career appearances, Mendoza has a record of 59-40 with 16 saves and a 4.30 ERA. Bryan Hoch is a contributor to MLB.com.
