    "body": "BRADENTON, Fla. -- Twelve months ago, southpaws Zach Duke and Paul Maholm were a couple of highly-touted prospects who had combined for all of nine appearances above the Class A level.  In 2006, the Pirates will be looking for the talented duo to comprise 40 percent of their big-league starting rotation.  While the thought of putting so much responsibility on a pair of untested arms might cost some baseball officials a good bit of sleep at night, Pirates general manager Dave Littlefield and manager Jim Tracy don't seem all too concerned about the prospect of having Duke and Maholm take the ball every fifth day this season. In fact, they seem to be downright delighted with the notion. Ed Eagle is a reporter for MLB.com. This story was not subject to the approval of Major League Baseball or its clubs.",
