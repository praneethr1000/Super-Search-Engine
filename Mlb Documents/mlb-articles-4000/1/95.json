    "body": "DETROIT -- The Tigers will visit Troy, Dearborn, Grand Rapids, Lansing, Ann Arbor and Toledo on their Winter Caravan. Their next scheduled stop could be your home.  For the first time, the team's annual caravan tour will have a chance to make a house call thanks to the \"Your Tigers, Your Town, Your House\" sweepstakes. One lucky fan who submits the winning essay online will receive a visit from one of the Tigers' two caravan buses on Tuesday, Jan. 24.  Entrance in the contest is simple. Fans ages 18 or older can submit an essay at detroittigers.com explaining in 50 words or less why the Tigers should visit their house. Entries will be judged on originality, enthusiasm and geographic feasibility. Submission deadline is Wednesday, Jan. 18 at 9 a.m. ET, with judging taking place by a panel soon after. From there, either the West Tour or the Metro Tour will make a special stop in the winner's home city and greet them personally on the second day of the Tigers caravan. Which bus makes the visit depends on where the winner lives.   The Metro Tour will feature new manager Jim Leyland, sluggers Magglio Ordonez and Craig Monroe, staff ace Jeremy Bonderman, closer Todd Jones, second baseman Placido Polanco, top prospect Justin Verlander and coaches Lloyd McClendon and Rafael Belliard. The West Tour will head to Grand Rapids, Lansing and Ann Arbor with new starter Kenny Rogers, fellow lefties Mike Maroth and Nate Robertson, first baseman Chris Shelton, center fielder Curtis Granderson, prospect Joel Zumaya, president\/general manager Dave Dombrowski and coaches Gene Lamont and Chuck Hernandez.
