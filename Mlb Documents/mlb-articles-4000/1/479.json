    "body": "ARLINGTON -- In wooing free agent pitcher Kevin Millwood, Rangers owner Tom Hicks asked the right-hander about pitching in the extreme hitter-friendly Ameriquest Field in Arlington.  Millwood told Hicks that his job was to beat the other pitcher, not worry about the ballpark.  Hicks loved the answer so much that he gave Millwood a five-year contract potentially worth $60 million. \"I've had guys in the past who were 15-10 with a [4.50 ERA] and guys who were 8-15 with a [3.50 ERA],\" Connor said. \"I'll take the guy who wins ballgames. We made a lot of strides last year in the belief they can pitch up here and win. We've got to continue that.\"        Rangers manager Buck Showalter has known Connor since 1980, when they were both in the Yankees farm system. Showalter hired Connor as his first pitching coach with the Yankees and again when he took over the Arizona Diamondbacks.         Connor does not bring revolutionary concepts. He acknowledged that most pitching coaches teach the same things: throw strikes, keep the ball low and change speeds.         T.R. Sullivan is a reporter for MLB.com.
