    "body": "It was a big bookkeeping day for baseball. Approaching the deadline for teams and arbitration-eligible players to exchange salary figures, many simply exchanged signatures.

That activity reduced to 43 the number of players still in the process.  The big winner in terms of contract length was Washington catcher Brian Schneider, who signed a four-year, $16 million contract. The thinnest spread? Tampa Bay reliever Travis Harper asked for $900,000 and was offered $800,000.
