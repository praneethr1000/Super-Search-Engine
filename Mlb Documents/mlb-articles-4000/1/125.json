    "body": "For Dodgers general manager Ned Colletti, it was a simple matter of exchanging surplus for need. By acquiring right-handed starter Jae Seo and left-handed reliever Tim Hamulack from the New York Mets on Wednesday for right-handed relievers Duaner Sanchez and Steve Schmoll, Colletti and the Dodgers addressed their need for another starter in Seo. Meanwhile, GM Omar Minaya and the Mets addressed their need for relief help by picking up Sanchez and Schmoll, who combined for 127 appearances out of the Dodgers' bullpen last year.
