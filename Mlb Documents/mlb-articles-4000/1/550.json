    "body": "KANSAS CITY -- Third baseman Mike Moustakas is the last unsigned Royal, but his contract status isn't on the forefront of his mind. \"Not really,\" Moustakas said Saturday at Royals FanFest. \"I trust Scott [Boras] in what he's doing for me as my agent. I love Kansas City and I love the Royals. I think at the end of the day, we'll get to the point where both sides are where they want to be.\" Moustakas and the Royals filed their arbitration figures, the Royals offering $4.2 million and Moustakas countering at $7 million. But Moustakas also indicated the Royals and Boras have discussed a two-year deal which essentially would buy out his final two years of arbitration. \"There's been a couple talks about a multiyear deal, a two-year deal, also a one-year deal,\" Moustakas said. \"We're just trying to figure out what the best fit is for everything. They've been talking back and forth and trying to figure it all out. They give me the information and I go, 'Yeah, that's all right.' But I try to stay out of it because I love Scott and I love the Royals.\" But Moustakas doesn't deny he'd like to avoid the whole arbitration process -- a two-year deal would be appealing. \"That would be nice to not have the stress of another arbitration year,\" he said. \"That would be cool. But at the end of the day, I get to be a Major League baseball player, so I'm pretty happy about that.\" Jeffrey Flanagan is a reporter for MLB.com. Follow him on Twitter at @FlannyMLB.
