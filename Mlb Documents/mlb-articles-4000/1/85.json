    "body": "ST. PETERSBURG -- The Devil Rays added to their bullpen numbers Thursday by signing veteran right-hander Dan Miceli to a two-year deal, with a club option for a third year.  A 35-year-old right-hander, Miceli began the 2005 season pitching for the Yomiuri Giants of the Japanese Central League. He returned to the Major Leagues in June, going 1-2 with a 5.89 ERA in 19 appearances for the Rockies before injuring his foot.  To clear room for Miceli on the 40-man roster, the Rays designated right-hander Franklin Nunez for assignment. Miceli set a career high with 21 saves in 1995, when he had a 4-4 record with a 4.66 ERA. He has a 42-50 career record with a 4.51 ERA and 35 saves.   Miceli is well traveled, having pitched for the Pirates, Tigers, Padres, Marlins, Rockies, Rangers, Indians, Yankees and Astros during 13 Major League seasons.
