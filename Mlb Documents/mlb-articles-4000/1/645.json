    "body": "WASHINGTON -- Nationals third baseman Anthony Rendon, right-hander Stephen Strasburg, outfielder Ben Revere and infielder Danny Espinosa avoided arbitration on Friday by agreeing to one-year contracts. Rendon will make a reported $2.8 million, according to ESPN, while Strasburg is expected to make $10.4 million, a source confirmed. Another source confirmed that Revere will make $6.25 million, while Jon Heyman reported that Espinosa will earn $2.875 million. â€¢ Hot Stove Tracker Rendon had an injury-riddled season in 2015, playing in only 80 games because of a knee sprain and a quad injury. Rendon spent most of his time at second base, but he is set to move to third after the Nationals traded Yunel Escobar to the Angels last month. Rendon hopes to rebound and have a season like he had in 2014, when he hit .287 with 21 home runs, 83 RBIs and a team-leading 6.6 WAR. Strasburg, meanwhile, was injury prone for most of the first half of the 2015 season. Once Strasburg came back from his oblique injury, it was like watching the rookie who blew away the Pirates during his Major League debut in 2010. It will be interesting to see if the Nationals sign him to a long-term deal. He is a free agent after the 2016 season. Revere, who was acquired from the Blue Jays last week, is coming off one of his best seasons in the big leagues, hitting a combined .306 with 45 RBIs, 31 stolen bases and a .342 on-base percentage with the Phillies and Blue Jays in 2015. Espinosa had a productive season coming off the bench and still was a solid defender. It was a year where he played all four infield positions and left field. With Ian Desmond no longer on the team, Espinosa is the favorite to be the starting shortstop in 2016. The Nationals have signed all their arbitration-eligible players for 2016.
