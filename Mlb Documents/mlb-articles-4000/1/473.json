    "body": "NEW YORK -- The toe injury that cost Pedro Martinez time over the last two seasons and seemingly jeopardized the start of his 2006 season is the result of a habit he developed when pushing off the pitcher's rubber. The Mets pitcher recently told a television station in his native Dominican Republic that an \"irregular movement\" -- one he apparently didn't explain fully -- damaged cartilage in the big toe on his right foot. Martinez told the international station Color Vision, based in Santo Domingo, that a movement that he makes late in his delivery caused the problem, which developed in 2004, his final season with the Red Sox. The problem returned last summer and still bothered him enough in December that he delayed initiating his offseason conditioning. A recap of the television report was posted on ESPNdeportes.com on Friday. The recap made no mention of Martinez's offseason work, but Mets general manager Omar Minaya said earlier this month that the club's ace had begun workouts and that, last week, Martinez had begun throwing off a mound. MLB.com reported in December that a specially designed baseball shoe -- designed to alleviate pressure on the toe -- was being created for Martinez. The ESPNdeportes.com report said that Martinez will wear the shoe for the rest of his career.  \"I'm waiting for a special shoe, designed by a physician, which Nike is manufacturing so that my foot won't keep bothering me,\" Martinez was quoted as saying in the television report. \"They've got to remove a piece [of the shoe] that's under the damaged area.\"  Martinez explained the injury by saying, \"By having this irregular movement on my right foot, I've damaged the cartilage of my toe. The pain became insufferable during the 2004 season, and I had to take a cortisone shot in order to tolerate the pain and be able to help Boston win the World Series. Last year, the pain returned in June, but the doctors recommended that, rather than ignoring [it], I rehabilitate the foot instead, which is what we're doing right now.\"   According to the report, Martinez said that the shoe would allow him to pitch in the World Baseball Classic. \"I have faith in God, and I know I'll be ready. I'm being optimistic that I'll be able to play the World Baseball Classic and the 2006 season,\" Martinez said.  But Minaya said this week that Martinez's participation in the WBC was a \"50-50\" proposition. Mets coach Manny Acta, who will manage the Dominican team in the WBC, said yesterday, \"If Pedro's ready to pitch in Spring Training, he'll pitch in the Classic. He's so proud and committed to the Classic. ... I hope the shoe gets it.\"  Acta also noted that with the pitch limit in place for the WBC and the presence of \"four or five closers\" on the Dominican roster, Martinez won't be asked to pitch much.   \"He'll probably pitch as much as he would if he was in Spring Training,\" Acta said.
