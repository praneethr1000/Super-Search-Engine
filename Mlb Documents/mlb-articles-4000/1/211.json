    "body": "MIAMI -- Minor League infielder Josh Wilson, designated for assignment by the Marlins two days ago, was traded on Friday to the Rockies for a player to be named or cash.  A shortstop at Triple-A Albuquerque last season, the 24-year-old Wilson hit .257 with 17 homers and 82 RBIs. Called up by the Marlins in September, he appeared in 11 games and had one hit in 10 at-bats.  While Wilson has been a shortstop throughout his Minor League career, the Marlins were experimenting with switching him to second base. He played second in the Arizona Fall League. Wilson was in consideration to be a possible replacement at second for three-time All-Star Luis Castillo, who was traded to the Twins.   But when the Marlins signed veteran free agent Pokey Reese recently, Wilson's role changed. Expected to back up Reese at second are Rule 5 Draft pick Dan Uggla or Alfredo Amezaga, who is competing in the World Baseball Classic for his native Mexico. Joe Frisaro is a reporter for MLB.com.
