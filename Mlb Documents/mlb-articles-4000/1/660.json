    "body": "The Angels will pay a visit to their neighbors in the National Hockey League next month when the Anaheim Ducks host an Angels theme night on Feb. 5 at the Honda Center. Angels players and alumni will be in attendance for a pregame ceremonial puck drop prior to the Ducks' 7 p.m. PT matchup with the Arizona Coyotes. The night will feature a blended Ducks and Angels gameday presentation, merchandise and giveaways. Both the Angels Strike Force and the Anaheim Ducks Power Players will be on hand for photo opportunities with fans along the concourse, and one section of fans will have an opportunity to win an exclusive Angels giveaway. The third piece in the commemorative Surprise Puck series will also be on sale with proceeds benefiting the Anaheim Ducks Foundation. Tickets for the game are available through AnaheimDucks.com, Ticketmaster or at the Honda Center box office. Two ticket package options are available: the Angels Value Pack, which includes two tickets, two hot dogs and two sodas, and the Halos and Hockey Pack for one ticket, a T-shirt, puck and mini bat.
