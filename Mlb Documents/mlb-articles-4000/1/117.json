    "body": "Jeff Weaver's two-year stay with the Dodgers officially came to an end Sunday night, when the free agent pitcher and the club allowed a deadline to pass without reaching agreement on a contract.  Under baseball's labor rules, free agents offered arbitration have until Jan. 8 to re-sign with their former teams. After that, they can't re-sign until May 1 -- during which time Weaver is certain to sign with another club. Dodgers GM Ned Colletti had termed signing Weaver a \"long shot\" earlier in the week, so the lack of a deal shouldn't come as much of a surprise. Colletti and Scott Boras, Weaver's agent, planned talks over the weekend, but neither side had indicated much confidence that a deal would get done. John Schlegel is a reporter for MLB.com.
