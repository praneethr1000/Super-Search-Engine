    "body": "SAN DIEGO (AP) -- All-Star catcher Mike Piazza agreed Sunday to a $2 million, one-year contract with the San Diego Padres, giving the defending NL West champions a marquee player they think can still contribute.  Piazza, 37, had been interested in signing a free-agent deal with an AL team to become a designated hitter. Instead, he'll stay in the NL and return to the West Coast for the first time since the Los Angeles Dodgers traded him to Florida in 1998.  The 12-time All-Star holds the Major League record for most career home runs by a catcher (374). He has 397 homers overall, and is a career .311 hitter. ",
