    "body": "The Hot Stove may be cooling down, but many players still remain unsigned and others could be available on the trade market. Each day, rumors of potential transactions continue to surface. Here's a look at the latest developments from around the big leagues: Cubs, White Sox still in on Fowler Both Chicago clubs remain interested in free-agent outfielder Dexter Fowler, according to a CBS Chicago report. The White Sox and Cubs are keeping tabs on the market for Fowler daily, per the report. Fowler spent the 2015 season with the Cubs after he was dealt from Houston to Chicago last offseason. He hit .250 with a career high in home runs (17) and stole 20 bases through 156 games. Fowler, who turns 30 in March, rejected a $15.8 million qualifying offer from the Cubs in November, meaning any team that signs him must surrender its top unprotected Draft pick. â€¢ More: 2016 Draft order Fowler's payday prospects likely suffered from the stacked crop of outfielders available this winter, with several big names lingering on the market until recently. Alex Gordon, Jason Heyward, Justin Upton and Yoenis Cespedes also also entered free agency this offseason. Only Fowler remains unsigned, after Cespedes returned to the Mets recently. Marlins looking at Lincecum, Lee The Marlins may still be in the market to add another pitcher this winter. While Miami is giving preference to free agents willing to accept a Minor League deal with a Spring Training invitation, the club hasn't yet ruled out signing a pitcher to a guaranteed big league contract, according to MLB.com's Joe Frisaro. Frisaro said the Marlins intend to scout both Cliff Lee and Tim Lincecum but would pass if any perceived health risk arises. Additional free-agent options include Alfredo Simon, Aaron Harang, Kyle Lohse and Doug Fister as starters and potentially Tommy Hunter as a reliever. Lincecum, who is recovering from hip surgery, is expected to host a showcase for interested teams in February. The two-time Cy Young Award winner hit the open market for the first time this offseason after nine years in San Francisco. He's been linked to both the Marlins and Padres in recent days.
