    "body": "The A's on Monday reduced to five the number of arbitration-eligible players on their roster by signing outfielder Bobby Kielty to a one-year deal worth a reported $1.85 million.  Kielty had a base salary of $875,000 in 2005, but made more than $1 million by hitting various incentives.  After struggling through the worst year of his career in 2004, Kielty bounced back by batting .263 -- the second-best mark of his five seasons in the Majors -- with 10 home runs and a career-high-tying 57 RBIs in 116 games. A 29-year-old switch-hitter, Kielty made a team-leading 52 starts in left field and also started 37 games in right field. He'll likely enter Spring Training as Oakland's fourth outfielder, behind Milton Bradley, Mark Kotsay and Jay Payton.   With Kielty signed, the A's now turn their attention to signing right-handers Kiko Calero and Juan Cruz, catcher Adam Melhuse, infielder Mark Ellis and Bradley.
