    "body": "Ever wanted to correspond directly with the top prospects in baseball? Here's your chance.  Each January Major League Baseball and the Players Association bring together several of each club's top prospects to take part in the Rookie Career Development Program, a private, four-day gathering in which the players get to know each other and learn about life in the big leagues. MiLB.com will be there all weekend, rubbing elbows with the best Minor League Baseball has to offer, and we want to be your messenger. Simply peruse the list below and pick out a player you've always wanted to ask a question. Then all you have to do is email the question to us and we'll do our best to get the player to give you a video response which will be posted on MiLB.com at the conclusion of the program.  Be sure to include your name, where you are writing from and which player you're writing to when you send in your question.    Players scheduled to attend:  Arizona: Stephen Drew, Conor Jackson, Miguel Montero, Carlos Quentin, Chris Young  Atlanta: Blaine Boyer, Jeff Francoeur, Brian McCann Baltimore:Adam Loewen, Nick Markakis, Hayden Penn, Sendy Rleal Boston: Manny Delcarmen, Craig Hansen, Cla Meredith Chicago (NL): Rich Hill, Ricky Nolasco, Felix Pie, Ryan Theriot Chicago (AL): Brian Anderson, Jerry Owens Cincinnati: William Bergolla, Phillip Dumatrait, Brian Shackelford, Allan Simpson Cleveland: Ryan Garko, Edward Mujica, Rafael Perez, Brad Snyder Detroit: Tony Giarratano, Justin Verlander, Joel Zumaya Florida: Robert Andino, Jeremy Hermida, Scott Olsen Houston: Taylor Buchholz, Jason Hirsh, Fernando Nieve, Luke Scott Kansas City: Brian Bass, Ambiorix Burgos, J.P.
