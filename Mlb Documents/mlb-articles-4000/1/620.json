    "body": "Major League Baseball's rumor mill was in full swing Tuesday, with plenty of speculation regarding the free-agent and trade markets. Here's a look at the latest Hot Stove rumblings from around the big leagues: Rockies open to dealing outfielder With a crowded outfield after signing Gerardo Parra to a multiyear deal, the Rockies are in trade talks with multiple clubs and are likely to move either Carlos Gonzalez, Charlie Blackmon or Corey Dickerson, reports MLB.com's Thomas Harding. FOX Sports, citing a source, reported the Rockies are in \"ongoing trade talks\" with the Orioles and Tigers involving Colorado's outfielders. However, no deals appear imminent. It's also unclear which player the Tigers are targeting. Gonzalez, owed $37 million over the next two years, has been linked to the O's before. The Angels are another potential trade fit, though they have not had \"substantive trade conversations\" with the Rockies, according to the Los Angeles Times. Blackmon, who filed for salary arbitration Tuesday, is under club control for three years, while Dickerson is a year from arbitration and under club control for four years. Rays active in trade market The Rays are actively involved in multiple trade conversations regarding both starting pitchers and relievers, according to Ken Rosenthal of FOX Sports, though no specific players were named. The Rays are said to be looking for offense in return and appear to line up with the Cubs and Rockies, among others, per Rosenthal. During last month's Winter Meetings, there were rumors of trade talks between the Rays and Cubs, with infielder Javier Baez a potential target for Tampa Bay. The Rockies meanwhile, are said to be shopping multiple outfielders. Mets hopeful for one-year deal with Cespedes It's a long shot, but the Mets would be open to a one-year contract with Yoenis Cespedes if the outfielder is willing to accept such a deal, reports MLB.com's Anthony DiComo. However, the general consensus around the game is that it's extremely unlikely that Cespedes and his representatives abandon their search for a lucrative multiyear deal. The more likely scenario is a cheaper role player signing with the Mets, with outfielders Ryan Raburn, Chris Denorfia and Delmon Young said to be possible fits. Ozuna off trading block? The Marlins are unlikely to deal outfielder Marcell Ozuna now that the club has signed Wei-Yin Chen, tweets MLB.com's Joe Frisaro. Ozuna has been mentioned in trade rumors since last summer, but the Marlins were seeking a starting pitcher in return and Chen fills that need. The Marlins have five outfielders on their 25-man roster and were linked to free agent Jeff Francoeur earlier this week. Kennedy drawing interest It appears free agent Ian Kennedy has a wide range of suitors as he decides where to pitch in 2016. The Royals, Nationals, Astros and Rockies are the most likely destinations for the right-hander, according to MLB Network's Jon Heyman. Kennedy, 31, is tied to Draft-pick compensation because he declined a qualifying offer from the Padres. He went 9-15 with a 4.28 ERA in 30 starts last season with San Diego.
