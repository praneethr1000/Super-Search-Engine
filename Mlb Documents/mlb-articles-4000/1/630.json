    "body": "The ongoing shuffle of Major League ballplayers is shaking up the lineups that will compete in the 2016 season -- and ESPN has shaken up the broadcast lineups to cover the action. No trades or free-agent signings by the network, but plenty of in-booth overshifting. Jessica Mendoza, who became the network's first female game analyst late last season when she stepped in for Curt Schilling after Schilling was taken off the \"Sunday Night Baseball\" broadcasts for making a controversial remark on social media, remains as a permanent part of the Sunday team. Schilling will return to game analysis for \"Monday Night Baseball\" broadcasts. The new face belongs to Aaron Boone, the former infielder and an ESPN veteran who had been cutting his broadcasting teeth on the Monday night telecasts, while John Kruk will now bump back to in-studio analysis. â€¢ 2016 national broadcast schedule Returning for their sixth season as the rocks on the crew are play-by-play man Dan Shulman and reporter Buster Olney. In a significant behind-the-curtain change, Andy Reichwald takes over as \"Sunday Night Baseball\" producer after 14 seasons of filling the same role on Monday nights. New to the \"Monday Night Baseball\" booth will be Eduardo Perez. He and Schilling are essentially taking over not only for Boone, but for Mark Mulder and Dallas Braden, the former pitchers who split the 2015 season as analysts. Broadcast vets Karl Ravech and Dave Flemming will share play-by-play responsibilities on the \"Monday Night Baseball\" circuit.
