    "body": "ST. PETERSBURG -- Devil Rays pitching coach Mike Butcher has yet to meet many of the guys who will pitch for Tampa Bay this season. But that doesn't bother Butcher, who has the important task of turning a group of talented young hurlers into big-league pitchers who can get outs and help the Rays win ballgames. \"I think it will work as a positive,\" said the 40-year-old Butcher about coming over from the Angels farm system having only seen video of most of Tampa Bay's pitchers. \"My former position was the [pitching] coordinator, and you'd get 15 to 20 new pitchers every year and you try to make an impact on those guys when you first meet them. So not knowing these guys personally, as of right now, I don't think it's going to be a problem at all.\" The upcoming season will be Butcher's first as a coach in the Major Leagues. A longtime Minor League pitching coach, Butcher was a relief pitcher with the Angels when Rays manager Joe Maddon was an assistant coach, and the two hooked up again when Butcher began coaching in the Angels organization.
