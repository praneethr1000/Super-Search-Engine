    "body": "Major League Baseball will seek on Wednesday to mediate its dispute with District of Columbia officials regarding construction of a new downtown ballpark for the Washington Nationals, baseball's second-ranking official said on Tuesday night.  The step was necessitated because the D.C. City Council failed to meet a contractual deadline of Dec. 31 to sign a lease with MLB, plus secure a site and financing for the ballpark, which was originally pegged at $535 million.  \"Under contract, we have a right [and obligation within 10 days] to file for mediation as a prelude to any other action,\" said Bob DuPuy, MLB's president and chief operating officer, in an e-mail message. \"The mediation step is a contractual provision designed to allow the parties to try to resolve any impasses.
