    "body": "The Padres have added a lefty to their starting rotation, agreeing to terms with veteran Shawn Estes on a one-year contract in excess of $1 million upon completion of a physical examination by the club.  Estes, who turns 33 on Feb. 18, went 7-8 with a 4.80 ERA in 21 starts for the Arizona Diamondbacks in 2005. He was limited to 21 starts, his lowest total since 1996, after suffering a stress reaction in his left ankle July 5 at St. Louis.  Across 11 Major League seasons with the Giants, Mets, Reds, Cubs, Rockies and Diamondbacks, Estes is 99-89 with a 4.71 ERA in 273 games, including one relief appearance.
