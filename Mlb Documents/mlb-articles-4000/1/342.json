    "body": "BOSTON -- Upon his return to his first full day on the job Wednesday, Red Sox general manager Theo Epstein did not lack for things to do -- or holes to fill.  Epstein will be busy for the foreseeable future trying to determine who will be his starting center fielder, shortstop and leadoff hitter come April 3 in Texas.  Trade winds: Epstein, referring to the team's new emphasis on not publicly disclosing details of on-going trade talks, did not speculate on a possible deal that would send Cleveland outfielder Coco Crisp to Boston to replace Johnny Damon as the club's center fielder and leadoff hitter. Nor did he disclose any potential discussions with Eric Goldschmidt, the agent for free agent shortstop Alex Gonzalez. Epstein did acknowledge that he and his staff are working to fill the void by Damon's departure to the Bronx, stopping short of offering any details on where that search has lead him.   \"You'll probably understand if we offer a polite 'no comment,'\" he said. \"There's still some work to be done this offseason and center field is something we have to address before Opening Day, but we feel there's plenty of time [until then].\"   Mota matters: Neither Epstein nor assistant GM Jed Hoyer would elaborate on talks with the Indians revolving around Guillermo Mota. But Hoyer, who helped bring the 26-year-old reliever to Boston (along with Josh Beckett) in a Thanksgiving Day trade with Florida, reiterated that the team was comfortable with trading for the two pitchers despite not bringing either player in for an actual on-site physical exam.   \"On a physical issue, I think we felt comfortable,\" Hoyer said of the deal struck three weeks after Epstein's Halloween departure. \"We looked at the medical file of both players and felt that an actual physical examination would not make our decision. We felt comfortable and our doctors felt comfortable after looking at the medical files on both those players.\"   But the Indians did bring Mota to Cleveland on Tuesday for such an exam. Mota's agent denied that the fireballing reliever had not passsed the exam based on past troubles with his right shoulder, as reported by the Associated Press on Tuesday night.   Managerial talk: Once Epstein has filled the needs of center field and shortstop, he could possibly move onto exploring a contract extension for skipper Terry Francona, whose deal expires at the end of this season.   \"I think what's most appropriate to say is that we place a tremendous value on Terry and the job he does in this organization, and I don't think we would be the organization we are without Terry Francona,\" Epstein said of the only manager to lead the Red Sox to a World Series win in the last 87 years. \"As for his contract status, I hope you will understand that it's a confidential matter and we'll deal with it behind the scenes, and when there's something official to announce, you guys [the media] will be the first to know.\"   Francona, in two seasons as Red Sox manager, became the first manager to lead the team to the playoffs in his first two seasons on the job, compiling a 193-131 record in the process. In addition, his 193 wins over his first two years is more than any other skipper in team history.  Mike Petraglia is a contributor to MLB.com.
