    "body": "MINNEAPOLIS -- Nine times and still no charm for Bert Blyleven.  The Hall of Fame election results were announced Tuesday afternoon and once again, the former Twins pitcher, who ranks fifth on baseball's all-time strikeout list, did not receive enough votes for induction.  Though it was another year without a call for Blyleven, this year's election results seemed to be more encouraging than past seasons. Only one player was chosen from the ballot by the 520 members of the Baseball Writers Association of America and it was another pitcher who waited his fair share of time for election, Bruce Sutter. This was Sutter's 13th year of eligibility and seeing the former reliever finally get selected for Cooperstown brought a smile to Blyleven's face. That includes 287 wins, which is 25th on the all-time list. He is fifth in career strikeouts with 3,701. He is ninth in games started with 685. His 60 shutouts are also ninth all-time. But many are still not convinced, since he lacks benchmark achievements such as 300 victories or a Cy Young Award. He also had only two All-Star Game invites.     \"It's nice because they compare my numbers with the current Hall of Famers and see how I rank,\" Blyleven said late in 2005. \"I don't want to sound negative, but [the writers] don't know how difficult it is to win a Major League game or to stand on the mound and not get run support.\"       Kelly Thesier  is a reporter for MLB.com.
