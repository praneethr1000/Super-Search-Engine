    "body": "BOSTON -- They served as bookends for Larry Lucchino and Theo Epstein at the front end of a horseshoe table Wednesday in Fenway Park's media room.  But for the last 10 weeks, assistant general manager Jed Hoyer and the club's senior vice president of baseball personnel Ben Cherington were arguably the glue that held the front office together as the team went about day-to-day baseball business.  That's why Epstein and Lucchino both were so ready and willing to heap praise on the two former co-general managers. They know without the help and cooperation of the loyal duo, Epstein's return likely wouldn't have come to pass. \"It was their hard work and selfless attitude over the last 10 weeks that helped us get to this point,\" Lucchino repeated Wednesday from his Tuesday night statement. \"We do have a stronger, bolder front office as a result of this. And that has a lot to do with the guys sitting up here with us as well.   \"Ben and Jed got some important on-the-job training during this last 10-week period. I think there is a higher degree of comfort between baseball operations and the rest of the organization. There's a great deal of sensitivity now, and that is one of the major benefits of the last several weeks.\"   Cherington and Hoyer made it clear Wednesday that they were under no false pretenses about holding fort while Epstein continued to negotiate for his old job.   \"We made it clear at that time, as Larry said, that we hoped that it would leave the light on for Theo to return,\" Cherington said. \"The word 'momentum' has been used by Larry and Theo, and that's a good word. It continued after that [news conference] and the fact that he is returning is a successful outcome for all of us.\"   \"They were never designated as interim general manager, with an [emphasis] on a capital 'I.' Their expectation was that there was a possibility that they could operate that way,\" Lucchino added. \"They were designated as co-GMs and were kind of serving in an interim basis. But effectively, they knew we didn't talk about term [length]. We indicated that we were keeping the light on in the window at that press conference. We made clear of the possibility of Theo's return and they entered the job knowing that.\"   While Epstein was gone, it was Cherington and Hoyer who worked with fellow baseball operations executives like Bill Lajoie and Craig Shipley to engineer trades for front-line starter Josh Beckett, third baseman Mike Lowell, reliever Guillermo Mota and second baseman Mark Loretta. They also signed pitcher Bronson Arroyo to a three-year contract extension.   \"I don't think it was much of challenge,\" Cherington said of his title in team's trade talks with other clubs. \"When Jed and I were asked to take on that role, we both knew this was an arrangement we were going to try and we were going to see how it works. We were going to do that because we felt that was the best solution for the Red Sox.\"   \"They were the ones making the calls to other organizations and they were ones getting these trades done,\" Epstein said. \"They're the ones who deserve the credit. They would call me and say, 'Hey, from the way you look at things, would you do this trade? Would you look at player 'X' or player 'Y'? What do you think is an appropriate contract for player 'Z'?'\"   Several days after the Loretta trade for Doug Mirabelli -- and after the Red Sox had finished interviewing the likes of GM candidates Jim Beattie and Jim Bowden -- Boston awarded Cherington and Hoyer with the titles of co-GM at a Dec. 12 news conference at Fenway.   \"In terms of operating with other clubs, I don't think that was difficult, because Jed has good relationships with other clubs [and] I have good relationships with other clubs, so I don't think that was an inhibiting factor,\" added Cherington.   In the end, Hoyer repeated the sentiment first uttered by team chairman Tom Werner, that this was a good day for the Red Sox.   \"We knew there was some momentum, some conversations, but at the same time we had no sense of timing, no sense of what point, if at all, there would be a comfort level [between Epstein and Lucchino],\" Hoyer said. \"We were hopeful this day would come, but at the same time there was no certainty or schedule. We certainly had to operate as co-GMs with this possibility, but it wasn't difficult with other clubs. Those relationships proved to be very strong. No one dealt with us as if we didn't have authority.\" Mike Petraglia is a contributor to MLB.com. This story was not subject to the approval of Major League Baseball or its clubs.",
