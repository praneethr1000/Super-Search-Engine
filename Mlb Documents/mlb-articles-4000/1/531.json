    "body": "DENVER -- Right-hander Josh Fogg, a beloved and key member of the Rockies' rotation during their National League championship year of 2007, has agreed in principal to return to the club under a Minor League contract, the Rockies confirmed Friday. Fogg, 32, went 10-9 with a 4.94 ERA in 2007 and won several matchups with big-name pitchers. Fogg signed with the Reds last season and went 2-7 with a 7.58 ERA in 22 games, including 14 starts. He'll join a competition for two spots in the rotation or a bullpen job. The Rockies have Aaron Cook, Ubaldo Jimenez and Jason Marquis in line for the rotation. The plan was for one spot to be an open competition, and the shoulder problems that marred Jeff Francis' 2008 have yet to heal and could prevent him from opening the season in the rotation. Left-handers Glendon Rusch, Jorge De La Rosa, Franklin Morales and Greg Smith, and right-handers Jason Hirsh, Greg Reynolds and Matt Belisle are competing for rotation spots. Fogg has Major League experience in the bullpen, as do Rusch and Belisle.  Thomas Harding  is a reporter for MLB.com.
