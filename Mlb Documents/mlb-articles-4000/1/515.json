    "body": "HOUSTON -- The best and brightest of the 2005 Houston Astros World Series team were honored at the annual Baseball Dinner Friday night at the Hilton Americas Hotel near Minute Maid Park.  Players addressed reporters prior to taking their seats in the grand ballroom, and not surprisingly, the honorees were asked their thoughts about a long-time Astro whose status with the team is still unknown.  Hours before the dinner, the Astros filed the insurance claim in their first step toward recouping $15.6 million of the $17 million owed Jeff Bagwell in 2006, the final year of his contract. The club would like for Bagwell not to report to Spring Training, but Bagwell is planning to go. Alyson Footer is a reporter for MLB.com.
