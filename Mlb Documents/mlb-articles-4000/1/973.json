    "body": "The Yankees moved to supplement their catching depth on Wednesday, agreeing to a Minor League contract with veteran backstop Carlos Corporan. Corporan, 32, will provide competition as Gary Sanchez -- who is rated as the Yanks' No. 5 prospect, according to MLB Pipeline -- looks to make the roster as Brian McCann's backup. Austin Romine is also expected to compete for the backup catching job. â€¢ Hot Stove Tracker In 33 games for the Rangers last season, Corporan batted .178 with three home runs and 15 RBIs, catching 26 percent of potential basestealers. The switch-hitter owns a career .218 average over six Major League seasons with the Brewers, Astros and Rangers. Yankees general manager Brian Cashman has said that he expects Sanchez to make a \"significant run\" at the backup catching position, with his success in the Arizona Fall League clearing the way for the club to deal catcher John Ryan Murphy to the Twins for outfielder Aaron Hicks.
