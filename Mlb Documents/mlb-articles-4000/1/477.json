    "body": "PHILADELPHIA -- After a week of false starts and tweaks, the Phillies acquired Cleveland reliever Arthur Rhodes for outfielder Jason Michaels. The off-again, on-again deal between the clubs rested for good in the on position late Friday afternoon, when the Phillies announced Rhodes passed a physical in Philadelphia. That completed the Phillies' portion of a larger deal that led to Coco Crisp's long-awaited arrival in Boston. But that's another story. What matters to Phillies fans is that their team has added the primary setup man for closer Tom Gordon, and a substitute closer when necessary. Acquiring a veteran for that role ranked high on general manager Pat Gillick's list of offseason priorities, along with the still unfulfilled top-of-the-rotation starter. Rhodes, 37, went 3-1 with a 2.08 ERA in 47 games for Cleveland in 2005. Ken Mandel is a reporter for MLB.com. This story was not subject to the approval of Major League Baseball or its clubs.",
