    "body": "When Lee Arthur Smith first landed on the Hall of Fame ballot in 2003, he was supposed to be the one to finally break down the door to Cooperstown for firemen. Instead, his 6-foot-6, 240-pound frame has joined the tangle of relievers stuck outside.  Smith had all the requirements to blaze trails. He still does, maintaining his rank as the all-time record-holder in saves with 478.  But that record may not last long. Trevor Hoffman is 43 saves from taking it away from him, and along with it the main plank of his Hall platform. For someone who supposedly lacked impact, Smith certainly had his dominant years. During one six-year stretch (1985-1990), he averaged more than a strikeout an inning each season, with 580 total punchouts in 509 innings during that span. Gossage, reputed to be the fire-breathing flame-thrower of his era, did that only in four of his 23 seasons.      Tom Singer is a reporter for MLB.com.
