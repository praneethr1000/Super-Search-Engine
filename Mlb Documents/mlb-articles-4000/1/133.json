    "body": "MINNEAPOLIS -- With former pitcher Rick Aguilera a first-time name on the Baseball Hall of Fame ballot, there's no doubt fans will have many fond memories.  First, Aguilera was part of a superb New York Mets rotation with Dwight Gooden in the mid-to-late 1980s. In the 1990s, the right-hander's career was defined as one of the game's top closers -- mostly with the Minnesota Twins.  In 16 seasons from 1985-2000 that also included short stops with the Red Sox and Cubs, Aguilera earned two World Series rings. \"The '91 season stands above all the rest,\" Aguilera told MLB.com in 2004. \"Just the camaraderie we shared -- we had a very, very close team. We played together between the lines and were close away from the game. It was a very enjoyable season. The playoffs and World Series were just icing on the cake.\"    Overall, Aguliera amassed 318 saves, which ranks him 13th on the all-time list. He is tied for 54th all-time with 732 games pitched.
