    "body": "PHILADELPHIA -- An arbitration hearing will not be among the many events Matt Klentak experiences during his first season as the Phillies' general manager. This possibility was averted on Friday morning, when the Phillies reached a one-year agreement with right-handed pitcher Jeremy Hellickson, the club's only remaining unsigned arbitration-eligible player. CSN Philadelphia reported Hellickson will receive $7 million during the upcoming season. The club has not confirmed the deal. â€¢ Hot Stove Tracker Hellickson made $3.63 million while producing a 4.62 ERA over 27 starts with the D-backs last year. The veteran starter will be eligible for free agency at the conclusion of the 2016 season. The Phillies acquired Hellickson from the D-backs in exchange for Minor League pitcher Sam McWilliams on Nov. 14. Hellickson has produced a 3.97 ERA over the 131 starts he has made since becoming a fixture in the Rays' rotation during the 2011 season. But he has struggled since showing great promise during the early portion of his career. When Hellicksoon posted a 3.02 ERA over the 60 starts completed from 2011-12, he was considered one of baseball's top young starters. But he has produced a 4.71 ERA over the 71 starts he has made since the start of 2013. The Phillies reached agreements earlier this week with their only other two arbitration-eligible players -- Freddy Galvis and Jeanmar Gomez. Mark Bowman is a reporter for MLB.com.
