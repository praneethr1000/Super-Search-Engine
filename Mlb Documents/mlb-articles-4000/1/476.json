The Indians completed a trade Friday night that sent left-handed setup man Arthur Rhodes to the Phillies for outfielder Jason Michaels.  The deal is expected to spur a second trade in which the Indians would send Crisp, right-hander David Riske and backup catcher Josh Bard to the Red Sox for right-handed reliever Guillermo Mota, third base prospect Andy Marte, catching prospect Kelly Shoppach, a player to be named later and cash.
