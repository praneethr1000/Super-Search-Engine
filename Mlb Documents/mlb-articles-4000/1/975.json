    "body": "SAN ANTONIO -- Astros pitcher Brad Peacock said he will come to spring camp 100 percent healthy, and he expects to compete for a job in the starting rotation after undergoing surgery last year to remove bone spurs in his back to alleviate pressure on a pinched nerve. Peacock, who also underwent hip surgery following the 2014 season, was limited to just one game with the Astros last year while dealing with what had originally been diagnosed as a left intercostal strain. Last spring, he wasn't fully recuperated from his hip surgery, so he's eager to show what he can do. \"My hip always hurt, so I thought that's why I had the surgery and that was the problem, but it wasn't,\" he said. Peacock said he's back to full health and throwing as many as 25 pitches off the mound. \"I'm feeling good,\" he said. \"I will be 100 percent and ready to go. I just can't wait to play baseball again. I feel like it's been forever. It should be fun.\" Peacock, 27, went 4-9 with a 4.72 ERA in 28 games (24 starts) for the Astros in 2014.
