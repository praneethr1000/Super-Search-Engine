    "body": "BRADENTON, Fla. -- The Pittsburgh Pirates concluded their fourth and final full day of minicamp on Saturday with a drill known as the \"rag smash.\"  The sadistic-looking exercise featured Pirates pitchers standing near the back of a batting cage taking hard-hit grounders and line drives from a coach who was standing about 15 feet in front of the pitcher's mound.  Surprisingly, considering that the pitchers are in camp voluntarily, the drill was an absolute hit. The players cheered loudly as their teammates did their best Jack Wilson impersonations. And as it turns out, the Bucs have quite a few pitchers who can flash the leather. Ed Eagle is a reporter for MLB.com.
