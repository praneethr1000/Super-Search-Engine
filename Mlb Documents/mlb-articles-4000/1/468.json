    "body": "PITTSBURGH -- Despite stiff competition on Friday night from a Pittsburgh Steelers pep rally that was held at Heinz Field, the Pittsburgh Pirates established new attendance records this weekend for their annual PirateFest event.  The three-day baseball carnival attracted 15,361 total fans, surpassing last year's previous record total by approximately 1,000 fans. The Saturday crowd of 6,900 was the largest in the 16-year history of Piratefest.  \"This speaks volumes about the fans and the people of Pittsburgh,\" said Pirates All-Star Jason Bay, who was one of several players and coaches who participated in the event. \"They love baseball. It's a sports town and they want to see some wins. With the changes that we've made, I think this support shows that they believe we can do that.\" The record attendance also led to an increase in ticket sales. According to Pirates VP of marketing and sales Tim Schuldt, fans purchased hundreds of season tickets during PirateFest. And with more than two months remaining before Opening Day, the club is already close to surpassing the 9,000-plus full-season ticket equivalences that were sold for the entire 2005 season.   \"I think this shows how much excitement people have for this team and these players,\" said Schuldt.
