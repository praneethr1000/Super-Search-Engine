    "body": "PITTSBURGH -- The Pittsburgh Pirates on Monday signed southpaw Oliver Perez to a one-year deal believed to be worth $1.9 million, thus avoiding salary arbitration.  Perez, 24, emerged as one of the top left-handed pitchers in baseball in 2004, posting a 12-10 record with a 2.98 ERA in 30 starts with the Bucs. He also tallied 239 strikeouts in 196 innings and led all big league starters with 10.97 strikeouts per nine innings.  However, Perez did not participate in winter ball after his breakout season and reported to camp out of shape last Spring Training. His disappointing 2005 campaign took a turn for the worse when he broke the big toe of his left foot by kicking a laundry cart following his June 26 start at Busch Stadium.
