    "body": "HOUSTON -- The Astros on Monday signed shortstop Adam Everett to a one-year, $1.9-million contract plus incentives. The announcement was made by Astros general manager Tim Purpura. Everett, the Astros' starting shortstop the last three years, enjoyed his best overall season in 2005. He hit .248 and set career highs in home runs (11), RBIs (54), stolen bases (21), hits (136) and extra-base hits (40). Everett, who turns 29 of Feb. 5, became the third Astros shortstop to hit at least 10 home runs and steal 20 or more bases in the same season (Dickie Thon, 1983; Julio Lugo, 2000). Everett's 136 hits in 2005 were the most for a Houston shortstop since Andujar Cedeno collected 143 hits in 1993. Everett, who was acquired from Boston along with pitcher Greg Miller on Dec. 16, 1999, in exchange for Carl Everett, started at shortstop in all of the Astros' 14 postseason games last season and hit .212 in those games.  In the National League Championship Series win over St. Louis, Everett hit .304 with two RBIs, a double, and a triple. In 433 career Major League games, Everett has hit .253 with 27 home runs, 140 runs batted in, and 46 stolen bases. Jim Molony is a reporter for MLB.com.
