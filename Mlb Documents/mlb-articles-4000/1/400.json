    "body": "CLEVELAND (AP) -- The Indians and reliever David Riske avoided arbitration by agreeing to a one-year, $1.8 million contract Monday.  The right-hander made 58 appearances last season, mostly in middle relief. He went 3-4 with a 3.10 ERA and one save in 72 2-3 innings.  Riske, who has spent his entire six-year career in Cleveland, has a 17-12 career record with 16 saves and a 3.55 ERA. He set career highs of seven wins, 77 1-3 innings and 72 appearances in 2004. Cleveland has two players still eligible for arbitration: left fielder Coco Crisp and first baseman Ben Broussard.",
