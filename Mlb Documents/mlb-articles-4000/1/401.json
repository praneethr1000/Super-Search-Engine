    "body": "Fargo, N.D. -- Driving through the plains of the Dakotas in a bus wasn't exactly one of the images that Jason Bartlett had of what life would be like in the Major Leagues.  But that's exactly where Bartlett found himself as part of the Twins caravan on Monday morning, and after seeing the excited reaction on the faces of fans, there was no place he'd rather be.  \"Every time I look out the window, it's nothing but flat land and snow,\" Bartlett, a California native, said with a laugh. \"But as far as the towns we've been in, they've been nice and the people have been great. I'm really enjoying getting to see so many Twins fans.\" Kelly Thesier is a reporter for MLB.com. This story was not subject to the approval of Major League Baseball or its clubs.",
