    "body": "LOS ANGELES -- Dodgers second baseman Jeff Kent underwent surgery on Tuesday to remove scar tissue from the outside of his right wrist. The club announced that Kent is expected to resume baseball activities in four weeks and should be completely healed by the second week of March.  New shortstop Rafael Furcal is scheduled to undergo arthroscopic knee surgery on his right knee on Wednesday. He will have a slight tear of cartilage repaired and is expected to be fully healed by the start of Spring Training.  In addition to Furcal and Kent, Dodgers returning from operations are J.D. Drew (shoulder and wrist), Eric Gagne (elbow), Cesar Izturis (elbow), Jayson Werth (wrist) and Kelly Wunsch (hip and ankle). Furcal was signed, in part, because of the elbow injury to Izturis and the uncertainty of his return. Ken Gurnick is a reporter for MLB.com.
