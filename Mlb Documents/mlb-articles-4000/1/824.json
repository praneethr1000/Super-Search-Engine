    "body": "MIAMI -- The Marlins have finalized a one-year contract with Edwin Jackson, the 32-year-old right-hander who could fill a role either as a back-of-the-rotation starter or as a long reliever. A 13-year veteran, Jackson split time with the Cubs and Braves in 2015, combining to make 47 relief appearances. The Marlins announced the deal on Wednesday. • Marlins Hot Stove Tracker Jackson is owed $13 million by the Cubs in 2016 as part of the four-year, $52 million deal he initially signed with Chicago, which released him last season. Miami is expected to pay Jackson the MLB minimum, which hasn't yet been set. Jackson provides a veteran presence who adds depth to the rotation or bullpen. He broke in with the Dodgers in 2003, and he's also pitched for the Rays, Tigers, D-backs, White Sox, Cardinals and Nationals. In 2011, Jackson was traded from the D-backs to the Blue Jays on July 27, but on the same day, he also was dealt to St. Louis, where he ended up being part of a World Series winner. The right-hander was an American League All-Star in 2009 with the Tigers. In 2010, while with the D-backs, he no-hit the Rays in unconventional fashion, walking eight while striking out six. Jackson has a career record of 88-107 with a 4.58 ERA. Joe Frisaro is a reporter for MLB.com. He writes a blog, called The Fish Pond. Follow him on Twitter @JoeFrisaro.
