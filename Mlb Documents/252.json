    "body": "It is never too early to contemplate an annual mistake made by many who like to take a dip in the swirling waters of baseball prognostication.  The standard advice: Don't pick against the Atlanta Braves, or else you'll drown.  How many division titles have the Braves won in a row? Fourteen. This was an unprecedented record many division titles ago. And how many times have they been written off before a season even started? They have been written off almost annually in recent seasons, by many; each time, in each instance, in error. With this in mind, here is a prognostication on the 2006 prognostications for the National League East: It will be easier than ever to pick against the Braves this year, in large part because of the major offseason strides taken by the New York Mets.   The Mets finished seven games back of the Braves last year. This is not an insurmountable distance, especially since the ground the Mets seem to have made up this winter is more like a world of ground, rather than a mere seven games' worth.   They needed a primary, middle-of-the-order run producer and they got one in first baseman Carlos Delgado. There is no overstating the importance of this move. In the free agent class of the previous year, the premier run producer was Delgado, not Carlos Beltran.   They needed a new catcher and they got one of the first rank, Paul Lo Duca, who will make steady contact at the plate, who will work diligently with the pitchers, and who will be a solid citizen in the clubhouse.   The Mets also needed a top-shelf closer and additional help in the bullpen. To that end, they got the best closer on the free agent market, Billy Wagner. He is still throwing serious heat and he is a salt-of-the-earth fellow, who will not crumble before the task of pitching under Big Apple pressure. Plus, the club added the talented Duaner Sanchez, and more recently, another reliever with success in his resume, Jorge Julio.   Each move was greeted with universal approval. And why not? There is nothing here with which to quibble. The Mets got better. Much better.   Meanwhile, back in Atlanta, the Braves lost their shortstop and leadoff hitter, Rafael Furcal, to free agency. This was a substantial loss. Furcal disrupted the opposition on the basepaths, and he played some of the best baseball of his life in the second half of the 2005 season.   However, the Braves responded with the acquisition of Edgar Renteria, whose only shortcoming in a very substantial career was not playing up to expectations with the Red Sox last season. Over time, he has been a better defensive shortstop than Furcal, and a more productive hitter, too.   It is true that the Braves have only a semi-settled situation at closer. Chris Reitsma has the early lead for that role, but he was not quite the definitive answer last year.   Pitching coach\/guru Leo Mazzone is also departed from last year's squad. If he was the glue that held the Braves' pitching together all these years, then trouble is in the forecast. But manager Bobby Cox didn't win 14 straight division titles by being blissfully unaware of how to handle the pitchers.   Also in the Mets\/Braves mix, Julio Franco is now with New York following a five-year stint in Atlanta. This is a net gain for the Mets. Franco is the youngest 47-year-old on the planet, a man who stands as an inspiration to his younger teammates.   On the Braves' side of the argument, there is the usual evidence. Assuming anything approximating good health, the starting pitching will be a strength. It is, on paper at least, deeper than that of the Mets.   Plus, there is the intangible matter of the Braves being the leading find-a-way organization in baseball, at least during the regular season. Last season was a perfect example of the Braves digging deep and pulling out the division crown. Due to numerous injuries, Cox was forced to use rookies here, there and everywhere. But a funny thing happened on the way to the ballpark. The youngsters, instead of playing like rookies, played like the previous 13 installments of the Braves. And now, they're not rookies anymore. The Braves have a superb player development system that leads directly to an unmatched clubhouse atmosphere of professionalism and mutual support.   The Philadelphia Phillies must be considered a threat in the East Division, too. They finished a mere two games back of the Braves last season and only one game back in the NL Wild Card chase. Despite the loss of Wagner to the competition, they are still a very talented team.   The NL East was a tough neighborhood last year, the only division in baseball without a losing team -- though that could change this year with the Marlins. The Washington Nationals remained in contention most of the way, before a lack of run production caught up with them. They won't be bad this year, either.   You add it all up, and it looks like the Mets on top. Or at least it would look like the Mets on top, if the Mets weren't in the same division as the Braves. The certain lesson of recent history is that picking against the Braves in a division race is a ticket to an incorrect pick. Mike Bauman is a national columnist for MLB.com.
