    "body": "The Orioles have confirmed they've re-signed right-hander Eric Beaulac to a Minor League deal on Tuesday. Beaulac, 27, has pitched the past two seasons in the O's organization as a reliever. He was 2-0 with a 1.96 ERA in 12 appearances last season for Class A Advanced Frederick and Double-A Bowie. The Orioles selected Beaulac's contract from Bowie on Sept. 1 and immediately placed him on the 15-day disabled list in a move that would have created an extra injury-replacement spot for a postseason roster. They reinstated him and outrighted him to Triple-A Norfolk in October.Â  Beaulac was originally selected in the ninth round of the 2008 First-Year Player Draft by the Mets.
