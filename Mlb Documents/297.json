    "body": "SAN DIEGO -- They think they're getting better, but the Padres know for certain they're getting bigger.  In their largest move yet, anatomically speaking, they claimed first baseman Walter Young on waivers from the Orioles on Thursday.  At 6-foot-5 and 322 pounds, Young is believed to be the heaviest performer in organized baseball. Earlier this offseason, the Padres also acquired 6-foot-10 right-hander Chris Young from Texas. The pair of large Youngs, no relation, will be joined by Chris' former Rangers teammate, Doug Brocail, a 6-5 middle reliever. Lyle Spencer is a reporter for MLB.com.
