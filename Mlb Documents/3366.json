    "body": "FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. -- Former World Series star Jim Leyritz was ordered Thursday to take daily breath tests while he awaits trial on DUI manslaughter charges.  Judge Marc Gold said Leyritz must stay away from drugs and alcohol while waiting for trial, and he must blow into a machine three times a day to prove he is following orders.  Leyritz pleaded not guilty Thursday to a recently added charge of DUI manslaughter by unlawful blood-alcohol levels. He previously pleaded not guilty to a charge of DUI manslaughter with impairment in the death of Fredia Ann Veitch. Leyritz faces 15 years in prison if convicted. The 44-year-old ex-catcher did not speak on his way in or out of the courtroom. A message left for his attorney, Mike Dutko, was not immediately returned.   Police said Leyritz drove his sport utility vehicle through a red light Dec. 28 in Fort Lauderdale and crashed into Veitch's car. Blood-test results showed Leyritz's blood-alcohol content three hours after the crash was 0.14 percent, above Florida's legal limit of 0.08.   He played for six Major League teams and was last in the Majors in 2000, ending his 11-year career. In 1996, he homered for the New York Yankees in Game 4 of the World Series against Atlanta. The homer made it 6-6, and the Yankees won in 10 innings. New York took the Series in six games for its first title in 18 years.",
