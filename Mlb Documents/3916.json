    "body": "ARLINGTON -- The Rangers have announced a number of changes in their front office and in their amateur scouting department, including the return of Don Kalkstein as the club's sports psychology consultant.  Kalkstein, who has worked for the Mavericks since 2001, was with the Rangers from 1995-2005 as director of performance enhancement. He spent the past seven seasons working for the Red Sox.  \"I can't say enough great things about Donnie,\" Rangers infielder Michael Young said. \"He's a fantastic communicator. He understands that all players are wired differently and can reach everybody in the clubhouse on different levels. Players for the Red Sox loved him, and I'm sure the same can be said for the Mavs. He knows me very well and knows what gets me going. He's a great addition.\" T.R.
