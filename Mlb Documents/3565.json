    "body": "BOSTON -- On a day when reports linked the Red Sox to the top two starting pitchers still available on the market, Roy Oswalt and Edwin Jackson, general manager Ben Cherington offered some, but not complete, insight to the club's approach in a radio interview Wednesday with WEEI. CBS Sports' Danny Knobler reported that Oswalt received a \"significant\" offer from the Red Sox, while Jim Bowden of ESPN wrote on Twitter that the Sox have made an offer to Jackson. Bowden cited a source as saying Boston prefers Jackson to Oswalt. \"There's a lot out there,\" Cherington said on \"The Big Show.\" \"If we acquired every player we are rumored to be on, we'd need, like, an 80-man roster. I'd never comment on a negotiation, specifically. We're talking to a few different guys, we're considering different things. If there's a way to make our team better, whether it's the rotation of the pitching staff or whether it's another part of the team between now and Spring Training, we'll do that.\" Just how much the Red Sox are willing to spend has been debated following the trade of Marco Scutaro, a move Cherington said was financially motivated \"to some degree.\" It's the luxury tax that's been perceived to be the rub.  Though Scutaro, who was slated to be the team's starting shortstop before he was dealt to Colorado, was set to make $6 million this season -- and less than $5 million for luxury tax purposes -- Boston is currently pressing against baseball's Competitive Balance Tax threshold of $178 million, a collectively bargained figure.  The Red Sox surpassed the threshold last season, when it was also $178 million. Because 2011 was the second straight year Boston had gone above, the team paid a tax of 30 percent for every dollar spent beyond the limit.  Now, in 2012, if the Sox spend over $178 million, Boston will be taxed at a rate of 40 percent because it will have gone over three straight years. Cherington did not pretend that remaining below the threshold wouldn't be advantageous, but also said there's no directive to do so. The team's budget, he said, is not equivalent to the threshold.  \"First of all, Marco was a good player here, a very good player,\" Cherington said. \"When we picked up his option, we felt like the number on his option, the salary on his option, was a reasonable amount, so we picked it up. We had every intention of him being on the team. We got to the point in the offseason ... and we felt like there was an opportunity to reallocate that money in a more efficient way, for the team. We may not use all of it now, but over time, whether it's now or Spring Training or during the season, we feel like, given the options we had at shortstop, we feel like we can use that money.  \"There's a difference between saying we have gone over the luxury threshold and that there's no mandate not to do that this year. There's a difference between saying that and saying we don't have a budget. We do have a budget. They're two different things. They're not unrelated to each other, but they're not the same thing.\"  With Scutaro gone, Cherington indicated Mike Aviles could be Boston's starter at short, as opposed to a platoon of sorts with Nick Punto. Punto, Cherington said, has been a \"very good utility player,\" while Jose Iglesias \"may benefit from more time in Triple-A.\"  \"We need to get him into Spring Training and watch him, but he's certainly capable of being an everyday player,\" Cherington said of Aviles.  Cherington touched on other lingering matters, like David Ortiz's arbitration negotiations. Though Ortiz would no doubt prefer a multiyear deal, Cherington said Ortiz's decision to accept arbitration has in turn focused the discussions on a one-year offering. The compensation talks with the Cubs for Theo Epstein's departure, meanwhile, are on the back burner, as they've appeared to be most of the winter. Evan Drellich is a reporter for MLB.com.
