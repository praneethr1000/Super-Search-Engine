    "body": "ARLINGTON -- Rangers outfielder David Murphy has received a one-year contract to avoid arbitration. The next step for Murphy and his agent, Mike Moye, is to secure a multi-year contract from the Rangers to avoid free agency.  Murphy, who agreed to a $5,775,000 salary for 2013 on Monday, can be a free agent after this season, and the two sides have explored the possibility of a multi-year deal as well, according to assistant general manager Thad Levine.  \"When we went into the offseason, we identified a handful of players that we wanted to pursue multi-year deals with, and [Murphy] was one of them,\" Levine said. \"We have had conversations with Mike Moye on that. But we agreed with the firm deadline of arbitration, we want to get through this first and then continue that dialogue later.\" T.R. Sullivan is a reporter for MLB.com.
