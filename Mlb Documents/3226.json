    "body": "BOSTON -- At last, Red Sox manager Bobby Valentine heard the sound of Carl Crawford's voice. Valentine had spent a few weeks trying to reach his left fielder, but he had been limited to voicemails or texts.  Valentine sure sounded as if he felt it was worth the wait.  \"We finally got that call into Carl,\" Valentine said. \"Carl sounded great. [The conversation], yeah, it was long. [General manager] Ben [Cherington] was on the line and [Crawford's] agent and Carl, so we talked a long time. It went well.\" Getting Crawford back on track could play a big role in how successful Valentine is in his first season with the Red Sox. In 2011, Crawford was the one making the transition to Boston -- and it didn't go well. The left-handed hitter produced a .255 batting average with 11 homers and 56 RBIs in the first of a seven-year, $142 million pact, making it all the more important Crawford bounces back.   \"He seemed very determined,\" Valentine said. \"He seemed very understanding of the fact that things got spinning a little fast for him last year in a new environment, and he seemed to be determined to correct that.\"   Valentine has worked overtime trying to touch base with every player on his roster. He has made plane trips to visit with Josh Beckett, Dustin Pedroia, Clay Buchholz, Jacoby Ellsbury, Jarrod Saltalamacchia and many others.   This past week, Valentine visited the team's new training facility in Fort Myers, Fla.   \"The facility looks great,\" he said. \"I'm sure that it's going to be ready and I'm sure it's going to be a place we're going to get a lot of work done. Everyone should be proud of that. It's really beautiful. It looks neat from the road.\"   While at the complex, Valentine ran into Daisuke Matsuzaka, Ryan Kalish and prospect Luis Exposito.",
