    "body": "PITTSBURGH -- The Pittsburgh Pirates avoided the arbitration process altogether in 2006 by inking right-hander Kip Wells to a one-year deal worth $4.15 million on Tuesday.  Wells can also earn between $50,000 and $275,000 in bonuses, depending upon the number of innings he accumulates. The bonuses kick in at 195 innings pitched and top out at 210 innings pitched.  If the Pirates and Wells did not reach an agreement by Tuesday, the two sides would have been forced to exchange salary figures. Ed Eagle is a reporter for MLB.com.
