    "body": "MINNEAPOLIS -- It would be hard to blame Darrell May for being pretty quiet and reserved as he first surveyed the scene in the Minnesota Gopher locker room during this year's TwinsFest.  The 33-year-old pitcher was just taking some time to get used to the new setting as he prepares for Spring Training with his seventh team in seven years at the big league level.  May signed a Minor League contract with the Twins on Jan. 10 and will compete for the left-handed spot in the bullpen. Kelly Thesier is a reporter for MLB.com.
