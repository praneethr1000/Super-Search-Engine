    "body": "NEW YORK -- Commissioner Bud Selig's contract is expected to be extended for two more years through the end of the 2014 season, multiple sources told MLB.com on Tuesday.  The matter will be discussed with Selig, Major League Baseball's ninth Commissioner, during the first quarterly ownership meetings of the year on Wednesday and Thursday at the Sanctuary in Paradise Valley, Ariz.  Since the matter is not on the official agenda for Thursday morning's joint ownership meeting, it will be added for a vote under unanimous consent if Selig agrees to the extension. The approval must be unanimous under this procedure, and the executive council also would need to sanction the extension at its meeting on late Wednesday afternoon. Barry M.
