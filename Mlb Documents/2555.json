    "body": "The Rangers are on the verge of acquiring right-hander Yovani Gallardo from the Brewers, according to a FOX Sports report, which did not indicate what Milwaukee would get in return. Neither club confirmed the possibility of the potential deal. Gallardo, who turns 29 in February, is eligible for free agency following the upcoming season. He played high school baseball at Fort Worth (Texas) Trimble Technical before the Brewers drafted him in the second round in 2004. Gallardo, who was an All-Star in 2010, went 8-11 with a 3.51 ERA in 32 starts for the Brewers last season. He has made at least 30 starts in each of the past six seasons, and he has gone 89-64 with a 3.69 ERA in parts of eight Major League seasons, all with Milwaukee. Cash Kruth is a reporter for MLB.com.
