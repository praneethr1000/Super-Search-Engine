    "body": "CINCINNATI -- No free-agent players signed with the Reds on Friday, but the club still managed to bring in a big name.  Former Cardinals general manager Walt Jocketty was hired to be a special advisor to owner\/chief executive officer Bob Castellini.  Jocketty, who spent the previous 13 seasons as GM with St. Louis, will be involved with Castellini and general manager Wayne Krivsky in all matters relating to baseball operations. \"Clearly, he is a proven winner and his experience will be invaluable to me and to our entire organization,\" Castellini said. \"He wants to keep his hand in baseball this season. When you have the chance to hire someone with his credentials, you have to take advantage of that opportunity. We're doing everything we can to improve our franchise.\"              Mark Sheldon is a reporter for MLB.com. This story was not subject to the approval of Major League Baseball or its clubs.",
