    "body": "Former Padres hitting coach Randy Ready has joined Texas as Minor League hitting coordinator, the Rangers announced Wednesday while unveiling their Minor League staffing assignments.  Ready, a Dallas resident, appeared in 777 games and hit a career .259 with 40 home runs and 239 RBIs over parts of 13 seasons in the Majors with the Brewers (1983-86), Padres (1986-89), Phillies (1989-91, 1994-95), Athletics (1992), and Expos (1993). Ready spent the last eight years with the Padres organization, including serving as Major League hitting coach from July 31, 2009, through last season.  The Rangers also promoted Jake Krug from assistant to director of Minor League operations, where he will assist new senior director of player development Tim Purpura. Krug, who is entering his 10th season with the club, joins Purpura, new field coordinator Jayce Tingler and pitching coach Denny Clark. The Minor League staffs remain largely intact following a 2011 season in which the Rangers compiled baseball's best composite record.      Thomas Harding is a reporter for MLB.com.
