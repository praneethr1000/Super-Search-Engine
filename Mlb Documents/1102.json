    "body": "A month after trading hurlers Jake Odorizzi and Mike Montgomery to the Rays as part of the deal that brought James Shields and Wade Davis to Kansas City, the Royals added some pitching depth on Thursday, signing right-hander Blaine Boyer to a Minor League contract for 2013. Boyer, 31, was drafted by Atlanta in the third round of the 2000 Draft and went 9-14 with a 4.81 ERA in his 233 appearances with the Braves, Cardinals, D-backs and Mets during the 2005-09 seasons. The groundball specialist has allowed just 17 homers in 234 innings pitched.  The Royals plan to announce the club's Major League camp non-roster invitees at a later date.
