    "body": "MINNEAPOLIS -- Carlos Gomez didn't seem surprised that many people have reacted negatively to the four-player package the Twins will be receiving from the Mets in return for ace Johan Santana.  After all, he has barely heard his own name mentioned in the trade news.  \"The only thing I heard about was Santana, Santana, Santana,\" Gomez said Thursday when reached at his home in the Dominican Republic. \"Nothing in the news was said about Gomez, or nothing about the other players traded to the Twins. But I think all us prospects have the tools to play in the big leagues.\" While Gomez said he was excited about the chance to play in Minnesota, he didn't want to completely commit to his new organization until the deal was finalized. He mentioned seeing the reports on the Internet on Thursday afternoon that Santana and the Mets were still far apart in contract negotiations, although a deal is still expected to be finalized before the deadline.
