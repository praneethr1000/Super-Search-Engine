    "body": "KANSAS CITY -- Mark Gubicza was beginning to wonder if he would ever get the call. His name can be found in nearly every category among Royals career pitching leaders, but he had not been voted into the club's Hall of Fame.  That was corrected on Friday when it was announced that Gubicza would be inducted into the Royals Hall of Fame this season. Gubicza, who ranks third on the club's all-time win list with 132, will become the 22nd member and eighth pitcher inducted into the Royals Hall.  \"I'm extremely excited to get into the little family of the Royals Hall of Fame along with my extended family of Royals,\" Gubicza said Friday night. \"After a while, I was thinking it may or may not ever happen. What can I do at this point? I've put up the numbers. There's nothing I can do from afar.\" Alan Eskew is a contributor to MLB.com.
