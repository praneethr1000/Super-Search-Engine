    "body": "MILWAUKEE -- Infielder Mat Gamel and left-hander Chris Narveson will be full participants at the start of Spring Training camp after gaining medical clearance Sunday from the team's top doctor.  Narveson, who had surgery in May for a torn rotator cuff and labrum, and Gamel, who suffered a torn ACL in his right knee the same day Narveson went under the knife, were examined Sunday morning by Dr. William Raasch, the team's head physician. Both were deemed \"good to go,\" assistant general manager Gord Ash said.  Gamel also had surgery, and Ash said the Brewers will limit Gamel's running at the start of Spring Training and will ease him into the sort of \"extra\" work normal for a player preparing to play multiple positions. But Ash said Gamel should be able to participate in all of the regular camp drills. The Brewers expect to use Gamel as the starting first baseman in April and May while Corey Hart recovers from knee surgery. When Hart returns, Gamel could also see action in the outfield or at third base.   Narveson, meanwhile, threw his most recent bullpen session in Arizona on Friday without issue, Ash said.   \"[Manager] Ron [Roenicke] wants to be sure we're careful with him, which we're going to be, and we go slow,\" Ash said. \"But there's no restrictions.\"   Narveson will compete for a spot in the starting rotation.   Only three players on the big-league roster were expected to be limited at the start: Hart, left-hander Miguel De Los Santos (shoulder) and infielder Hector Gomez (groin). The Brewers claimed De Los Santos off waivers from the Rangers in September knowing he had a shoulder issue.   \"We decided we'd rather get him fixed now and get it over with instead of going into the season wondering when he's going to break down,\" Ash said. \"He should be back by July.\"",
