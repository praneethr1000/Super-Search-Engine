    "body": "BOSTON -- Ryan Kalish's right shoulder surgery on Tuesday was successful, the Red Sox announced Wednesday. Dr. Lewis Yocum performed the procedure, a right shoulder arthroscopy and posterior labrum repair, in Los Angeles. Kalish is expected to make a full recovery, but likely will not be available for Spring Training. \"I really am feeling the love on my surgery today. I really appreciate all of you,\" the outfielder wrote on his Twitter page (@Ryan_Kalish). I really am feeling the love on my surgery today. I really appreciate all of you  The surgery is a setback for Kalish, who's been held back by his health since his debut in the Majors in 2010. Were Kalish available for Spring Training, he appeared in line to earn playing time. Kalish, who turns 25 just before Opening Day, underwent a labrum surgery before, on his left shoulder in November 2011. Yocum also performed that operation. That surgery was Kalish's second in a two-month span. He had a bulging disc in his neck repaired in September 2011. That operation was handled by Dr. Joseph Maroon in Pittsburgh. Kalish is a lefty, so a silver lining this time around is that the ailing shoulder is not on his throwing side. A week ago Wednesday, two days before news broke that Kalish would be headed for surgery, he said he felt strong, but noted that swinging a bat was \"a little bit more of a challenge, and it has its ups and downs.\" Kalish's right shoulder is his lead shoulder when swinging. Red Sox teammates and others around the game have sent Kalish their well wishes. \"I shot him a text [Friday] night, and I think he was already asleep,\" third baseman Will Middlebrooks said. \"He's pretty down about it. I've worked out with him a few times here. He's been working hard to get ready for the season and fight for a position. To get news like that, it's pretty tough. He's taking it pretty hard.\" \"Praying my boy @Ryan_Kalish that he has a great surgery and gets healthy real soon,\" tweeted Daniel Nava, another Sox outfielder who's competing for playing time in 2012. \"We'll be missin ya buddy!\" Evan Drellich is a reporter for MLB.com.
