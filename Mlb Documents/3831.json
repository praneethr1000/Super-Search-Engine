    "body": "For Rich Gossage, his best shot at the Hall of Fame seems to be this, his ninth year on the ballot.  Each year, the Baseball Writers' Association of America is voting in increased numbers for Gossage, one of the top relief pitchers in history. Last year, when Cal Ripken Jr. and Tony Gwynn were elected, Gossage fell 21 votes shy of the required 75 percent. With no clear-cut first-time candidate on the ballot, he could very well make up the difference.  \"Well, I'm not going to get my hopes up too high,\" Gossage told MLB.com when reached recently by phone at his home in Colorado Springs. \"After coming so close last year, I'll just have to keep my fingers crossed and see what happens. I don't want to be disappointed. Maybe without the big guys on the ballot, that will enhance my chances. I'm just going to take it as it comes.\" Gossage is mostly remembered for his first tour with the Yankees (1978-83), but he had one his best years in 1984 with the Padres, finishing 10-6 with 25 saves and 84 strikeouts in 62 games (102 1\/3 innings). He was on the mound in the ninth inning of Game 5 against the Cubs in San Diego to close out the NL Championship Series, his final postseason save. That was also Gwynn's first complete Major League season of his 20 with the Padres.                 Barry M. Bloom is a national reporter for MLB.com.
