    "body": "PHOENIX -- It was a busy Tuesday morning for the D-backs.  After reaching a settlement just moments before a salary-arbitration hearing with catcher Miguel Montero, the D-backs settled with another arbitration-eligible player in third baseman Ryan Roberts, who will make $2.0125 million in 2012.  Roberts had asked for $2.275 million when arbitration figures were exchanged a couple of weeks ago, and the D-backs submitted a $1.65 million figure. Roberts was greatly relieved to have things settled a week before his scheduled hearing.   \"I'm not going to lie and say I didn't think about it every single day,\" Roberts said. \"It was definitely on my mind. I think the offseason went by really fast, but that certain thing seemed to take forever. I guess that's just because I thought about it so much. It is something that you think about a lot and you just kind of want to get it over and done with.\"   More than anyone, Roberts typified the 2011 season for the upstart D-backs. A longshot to make the team in Spring Training, he led all of baseball in batting average during the spring and wound up as the club's Opening Day third baseman.   Roberts went on to hit .249 with 86 runs scored, 25 doubles, 19 homers and 65 RBIs while getting on base at a .341 clip, as the D-backs unexpectedly won 94 games and the National League West title.   \"Every aspect I think,\" Roberts said when asked what he could improve on in 2012. \"Baseball is a game where you're never going to be what you want to be. I set my goals very high every year and just hope to reach half of them. This year, it's just go out and improve on all my numbers in every category, both offense and defense. I think there's still a lot to learn, a lot to do.\"   The Montero and Roberts signings leave the D-backs with left-handed reliever Craig Breslow as their lone unsigned arbitration-eligible player.
