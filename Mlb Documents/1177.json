    "body": "ARLINGTON -- The Rangers continue to dance with the possibility of signing free-agent pitcher Kyle Lohse, and they have remained in contact with agent Scott Boras.  Rangers general manager Jon Daniels won't talk about specific players, but acknowledged the club is still considering the possibility of adding starting pitching. Right now, Texas' fifth starter comes down to a competition between Martin Perez, Justin Grimm and possibly Robbie Ross.  But the Rangers are also looking at free agents, and Lohse, who won 16 games for the Cardinals this past season, is the best available starting pitcher on that list. T.R.
