    "body": "Roger Clemens, the seven-time Cy Young Award winner and current active leader with 353 victories, has been called to testify on Jan. 16 in front of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, along with the personal trainer, Brian McNamee, who told federal investigators and former Sen. George Mitchell that he injected Clemens with performance-enhancing substances numerous times from 1998 to 2001.  Andy Pettitte and Chuck Knoblauch, other players who McNamee named in the Mitchell Report last month, were also called to testify, as well as Kirk Radomski, the former Mets clubhouse employee, who supplied McNamee with the drugs. Radomski said in the report that he supplied at least 51 players with drugs over a 10-year period.  In what now has become a two-day affair, Mitchell, Commissioner Bud Selig and Don Fehr, the executive director of the Players Association, have been asked to appear before the same committee on Jan. 15, an invitation that was extended last month when Mitchell released his long-awaited report. According to Mitchell, McNamee told the feds and his committee this, in part, about Clemens: In 1998, when both were still with the Blue Jays, the trainer injected Clemens with the steroid Winstrol \"approximately four times in the buttocks over a several-week period with needles that Clemens provided.\"   \"On each occasion, McNamee administered the injection at Clemens' apartment in New York City,\" Mitchell wrote.
