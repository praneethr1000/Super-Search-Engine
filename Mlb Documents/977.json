    "body": "DENVER -- The Rockies parted ways with outfielder Kyle Parker, their top pick in the 2010 Draft, on Wednesday to make room on their 40-man roster for newly signed outfielder Gerardo Parra. The move was expected. Once a player is designated for assignment, the club has 10 days to trade him, release him or assign him outright to the Minors. Also, the player could be claimed off waivers by another club. Parker is expected to draw interest. The right-handed-hitting Parker, 26, saw action in 64 games over the last two seasons. He hit .182 with three home runs and 12 RBIs in 138 plate appearances in what has been a crowded Rockies outfield picture. After a strong Spring Training didn't get him an Opening Day roster spot, Parker spent most of last season at Triple-A Albuquerque. He overcame a slow start to hit .280 with nine home runs and 58 RBIs in 93 games. He was called up on June 9 and optioned back the next day, then recalled Aug. 1 and kept for the rest of the season. The Rockies selected Parker out of Clemson with the 26th overall pick in 2010. Parker also was the starting quarterback on the Clemson football team. He stayed in football through the 2010 season and played through a rib injury before becoming a full-time baseball player. Parra's three-year, $27.5 million contract became official Tuesday.
