    "body": "CHICAGO -- Single-game tickets for the Cubs' 2015 Cactus League games at newly named Sloan Park will go on sale Saturday. The Cubs announced the tickets will be on sale at the Sloan Park ticket office in Mesa, Ariz., starting at 11 a.m. CT\/10 a.m. MST. Fans also can purchase tickets online by visiting cubs.com, or by phone at 1-800-THE-CUBS (800-843-2827). This will be the Cubs' second season at the complex in Mesa. Last spring, they drew a Cactus League-record 213,815 fans in 15 home games, breaking the old mark of 203,105, which the Cubs set in 2009 at HoHoKam Stadium in Mesa. The Cubs open the Cactus League schedule at Sloan Park with a split-squad game March 5 against the Athletics. Starting Saturday, fans can purchase tickets in person at the Mesa ballpark, located at 2330 W. Rio Salado Parkway. The ticket office will be open from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. MST, Monday through Saturday. The Cubs announced the naming rights Thursday for the ballpark, which had been known as Cubs Park in its inaugural season. Sloan Valve Company, a 109-year-old Chicago-based company, has joined the Cubs as a Legacy Partner. Carrie Muskat is a reporter for MLB.com.
