    "body": "DENVER -- The Rockies and right-handed pitcher Jair Jurrjens have agreed to a Minor League contract that includes an invitation to Major League camp, Major League sources said on Friday. Jurrjens, who will turn 29 on Jan. 29, went 0-1 with a 10.61 ERA in two starts for the Rockies last season. A 2011 All-Star Game participant with the Braves who battled injuries in succeeding years, Jurrjens went 2-8 with a 4.54 ERA in 14 starts at the Triple-A level with the Reds and Rockies last year. Jurrjens joins the following Rockies non-roster invitees: Right-handed relievers Jose Ortega and Justin Miller; righty starter Brett Marshall; lefty starters John Lannan and Aaron Laffey; lefty reliever Jason Gurka; and catcher Audry Perez.
