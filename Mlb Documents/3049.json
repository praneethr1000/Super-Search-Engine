    "body": "SEATTLE -- Young pitching standouts Blake Beavan and Tom Wilhelmsen were among the players on the Mariners Caravan as it hit the road Monday for the start of a three-week, 25-city tour of Pacific Northwest communities.  Beavan and Wilhelmsen were joined by former third baseman and current broadcaster Mike Blowers, as well as the ever-popular Mariner Moose, as the tour kicked off in Yakima and Union Gap. The first week will also include stops in Wenatchee, Moses Lake, Spokane, Walla Walla and the Tri-Cities in Washington, as well as a stop in Coeur d'Alene, Idaho.  Current and former players, broadcasters and the Moose will host assemblies at elementary schools as well as free public autograph and photo sessions along their trek. Scheduled to appear at later caravan stops are catcher Chris Gimenez, pitcher Shawn Kelley, outfielders Mike Carp and Michael Saunders, former player Julio Cruz and broadcasters Dave Valle, Rick Rizzs and Dave Sims.   The group will make stops in the second week in Tacoma; Lacey; Olympia; Centralia; Portland, Ore.; and Longview before wrapping up the third week in Everett; Vancouver, British Columbia; Bellevue; and Lynnwood.   A schedule of public appearances for the caravan is available at www.mariners.com\/caravan. It will be updated regularly with each week's events and activities. Greg Johns is a reporter for MLB.com.
