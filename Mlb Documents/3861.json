    "body": "CINCINNATI -- As free-agent momentum has slowed to a crawl league wide this winter, the Reds could extend their search for a veteran starter beyond the offseason.  Trade activity could pick up during Spring Training camp, when teams will get a better idea of what they have -- and what they still might need.  \"There's still a month until spring and then at Spring Training, we'll have our scouts out at games,\" Reds general manager Wayne Krivsky said on Friday. \"Everyone will have a chance to evaluate players.\" \"There are always teams weighing what they would give up and get back in a trade vs. signing a free agent without having to give up any players,\" Krivsky said. \"That consideration is always out there.\"            Mark Sheldon is a reporter for MLB.com.
