    "body": "New Year's resolutions rarely last long. For example, my resolution for 2012 was to not write any contrived, hokey columns. And yet here I am, delivering a proposed resolution for each of Major League Baseball's 30 teams for the year ahead. (Thankfully, my other resolution -- to work more ice cream and buffalo chicken into my diet -- lives on. I've got a good feeling about that one.) Anthony Castrovince is a reporter for MLB.com. Read his columns and his blog, CastroTurf, and follow him on Twitter at @Castrovince. This story was not subject to the approval of Major League Baseball or its clubs.",
