    "body": "The Blue Jays signed infielder Maicer Izturis on Friday to a Minor League contract with an invitation to Spring Training. Izturis, 35, has not appeared in a Major League game since April 13, 2014, while recovering from left knee surgery and then right shoulder surgery in June 2015. He has been with the Blue Jays organization since '13 after signing a three-year, $10 million contract that offseason. Izturis made only 437 plate appearances for Toronto during that contract. Overall, he is a career .269\/.331\/.372 hitter across 11 big league seasons. He has spent time at third base, shortstop and second base and could compete for a backup infielder role with the Blue Jays. Jamal Collier is a reporter for MLB.com.
