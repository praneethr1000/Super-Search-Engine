    "body": "NEW YORK -- The Yankees will be seen again on PIX11 this season, returning to the channel that served as their over-the-air broadcast television home spanning the eras from Joe DiMaggio to Derek Jeter. The YES Network and Tribune Media Company announced Thursday that they have reached a multiyear agreement under which PIX11 has secured over-the-air rights to Yankees games in the New York area. Financial terms were not disclosed. PIX11 will televise approximately 20 games this season, with its broadcast schedule to be announced at a later date. PIX11 served as the broadcast home of the Yanks from 1951-98. The Mets also have an agreement with PIX11 that runs through 2017. YES, which remains the exclusive local television rights holder for the Yankees, will televise 125 games this season. The Yanks had over-the-air telecasts on My9 from 2005 through last season. \"We are eager to enter into this new chapter with PIX11,\" YES Network president and CEO Tracy Dolgin said in a statement. \"We look forward to working with PIX11 to bring all of the excitement, tradition and passion of Yankees baseball to fans throughout the tri-state area. At the same time, we have appreciated working with My9, which had been our local broadcast partner since 2005.\" Bryan Hoch is a reporter for MLB.com.
