    "body": "PHILADELPHIA -- The ripple effect of Guillermo Mota's inability to pass a physical in Cleveland may wind up squashing a proposed deal between the Phillies and Indians. Because Mota didn't pass a physical -- a standard procedure before a trade can be completed -- the Indians and Red Sox may have to rework a deal that would have sent Coco Crisp, David Riske and Josh Bard to Boston for Andy Marte, Kelly Shoppach and Mota. That in turn, endangers a spinoff deal in which the Indians would have dealt reliever Arthur Rhodes to Philadelphia for Jason Michaels, who would have replaced Crisp. Rhodes went 3-1 with a 2.08 ERA in 47 games with the Indians, but missed much of the final two months with a knee injury and off-the-field family issues. While it may have seemed like a small piece to the larger pie, it would have solidified the Phillies' bullpen, providing an eighth-inning setup man for closer Tom Gordon, and allowing Ryan Madson to move to the starting rotation.
