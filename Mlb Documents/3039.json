    "body": "ANAHEIM -- The tests Kendrys Morales underwent in Colorado last week came back positively, clearing the Angels' recovering first baseman to begin running on his own power and ramping up his baseball activities, general manager Jerry Dipoto confirmed Monday.  When he'll begin full-on sprints or get to a point where he can do everything on the field still remains to be seen. Dipoto doesn't want to set any dates. With Albert Pujols on board, and last season's first baseman Mark Trumbo still there, the first-year GM feels there's enough depth on the roster to allow Morales to recover at his own pace.  The 28-year-old switch-hitter has missed the last 1 1\/2 seasons with a broken left ankle suffered while stomping on home plate after a game-winning homer on May 29. Morales was then unable to run full speed the following Spring Training and underwent a second surgery this past May, putting him out of action for the entire 2011 season. If Morales -- arbitration-eligible for the second time this offseason -- is healthy and can somehow regain the form that put him fifth in American League MVP voting in '09, he can be a big boost to the Angels with regards to protecting Pujols.   Morales had been running on an unweighted treadmill and hitting off a tee in Arizona thus far. Alden Gonzalez is a reporter for MLB.com.
