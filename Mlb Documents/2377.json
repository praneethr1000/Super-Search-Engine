    "body": "ATLANTA -- The Braves added to their list of outfield candidates by claiming Eury Perez off waivers from the Yankees on Friday afternoon. Perez has totaled just 26 games at the Major League level since making his debut with the Nationals in 2012. The 24-year-old outfielder appeared in four games with the Yanks last year, but he spent most of his season with the Nats' Triple-A affiliate in Syracuse, N.Y. After hitting .311 with 20 stolen bases a .777 OPS in 57 games for Syracuse, Perez was placed on waivers and claimed by the Yankees on Sept. 22. New York designated Perez for assignment on Jan. 16 to create a spot on the 40-man roster for Stephen Drew. The speedy Perez has batted .305 and collected at least 20 stolen bases six times over eight Minor League seasons. Though he might begin the upcoming season with Triple-A Gwinnett, Perez will come to Spring Training with a chance earn one of Atlanta's backup outfielder spots.
