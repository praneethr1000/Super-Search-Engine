    "body": "CINCINNATI -- The Reds avoided arbitration with three of their five eligible players on Tuesday, signing left-handed reliever Bill Bray, right-hander Homer Bailey and shortstop Paul Janish to one-year contracts.  \"Contract is done...thanks to the @reds and my agents @OctagonBaseball. My family and I are extremely pleased,\" Bray tweeted.  Terms were not immediately known for the deals on Bray and Janish, but The Associated Press reported that Bailey's contract is worth $2.425 million. That's a significant raise from the 441,000 he made last season. Janish began the year as the regular shortstop but hit only .214 with 14 doubles across 336 at-bats. He lost his starting spot and after a brief stint at Triple-A Louisville, the 29-year-old often came off the bench and will be back in camp competing for a bench spot this spring.   Bray, 28, endured a litany of injuries over the years since he was part of a blockbuster seven-player trade between the Reds and Nationals in July 2006. The most serious issue was an elbow injury that required him to miss all of '09 and a large part of the '10 season.   Mark Sheldon is a reporter for MLB.com.
