    "body": "DETROIT -- As injury replacements go, Prince Fielder is a big one, probably the biggest since the Yankees replaced Aaron Boone with Alex Rodriguez in 2004. As win-now moves go, it's big enough to remind Tigers of the Miguel Cabrera trade four winters ago.  The Tigers plugged the hole left by Victor Martinez's injury with one of the best sluggers in baseball and gave themselves a stronger chance to not just win the American League Central, but to make a run at the World Series. They made the upcoming summer potentially one to remember at Comerica Park, not to mention the fall, and put themselves back in baseball's national spotlight.  Short term, they gave themselves the piece they needed to go for it all. Long term, they have some shifting to do along the way to get there. In the field, it's more delicate. Cabrera calls third base his \"natural position,\" the spot he manned for his final two-plus seasons with the Marlins. He played third in his first month as a Tiger in 2008 before Detroit moved him to first base, and he grew excited at the prospect of moving back there on a short-term basis had the Tigers advanced to the World Series last year.        With Fielder now on board, Cabrera says he's moving back.       A source close to Cabrera told MLB.com that Tigers officials approached Cabrera when he was in town last week to get his thoughts on Fielder as an option, and Cabrera told them he was on board with it. The idea, according to the source, was to give Cabrera time at third base, as well as DH, and some time at first.           Jason Beck is a reporter for MLB.com.
