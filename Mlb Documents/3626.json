    "body": "ARLINGTON -- The Rangers have signed a left-handed power-hitting first baseman who is a former All-Star.  Texas signed Brad Hawpe to a Minor League contract on Friday afternoon. The announcement came three hours before the Rangers' news conference to introduce Japanese pitcher Yu Darvish.  The announcement also comes at a time when there is speculation the Rangers might still pursue free-agent first baseman Prince Fielder. A source on Friday reiterated the Rangers' stance that they are unlikely to get involved in Fielder, especially at the current asking price. T.R. Sullivan is a reporter for MLB.com.
