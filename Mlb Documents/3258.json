    "body": "CLEVELAND -- Adam Everett's release by the Indians last season came amidst the club's youth movement at the Major League level. Everett has now returned to continue assisting Cleveland's future.  On Friday, the Indians announced that Everett has joined the front office as a special assistant to baseball operations. The former big leaguer will be in uniform during Spring Training, providing infield instruction and filling other roles at both the Major and Minor League levels.  During the regular season, Everett will continue to work with infielders throughout the Indians' player development system. Everett, who has known Indians manager Manny Acta since their days in the Astros' organization a decade ago, played 34 games for the Tribe during the 2011 campaign. He made the team as a bench player out of Spring Training, but he was released on June 30 to allow for the promotion of rookie third baseman Lonnie Chisenhall.   Everett considered retiring prior to last season, but he decided instead to sign a Minor League contract with Cleveland to see if he could crack the Opening Day roster. In his abbreviated stay with the Tribe, the 34-year-old hit .217, but he provided the type of solid defense that had been the signature of his playing career.   In 11 season in the Majors -- spent mostly as a shortstop between stints with the Astros, Twins, Tigers and Indians -- Everett compiled a .976 fielding percentage in 880 games (3,621 chances). He earned votes for a Gold Glove Award each season from 2003-06 while playing for Houston.   Everett was originally a fourth-round selection by the Cubs in the 1995 First-Year Player Draft, but he chose to play for North Carolina State University rather than signing. In '98, the Red Sox selected Everett with the 12th overall pick. He went on to hit .242 over the course of his big league career.",
