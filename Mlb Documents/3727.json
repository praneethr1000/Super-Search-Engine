    "body": "KANSAS CITY -- Infielder Chris Getz and the Royals agreed to a one-year contract on Monday. He became the club's second player to avoid salary arbitration.  Getz will receive $967,500 in 2012, a sizable increase from the $443,000 he earned last season. Catcher Brayan Pena came to terms earlier in the day.  As the Royals' regular second baseman most of last year -- he made 97 starts at that spot -- Getz finished with a .255 average in 118 games. His 97 hits included just nine for extra bases and he had 26 RBIs along with 21 stolen bases in 28 tries. In his two seasons with the Royals, Getz has yet to hit a home run in 604 at-bats. But last season he batted .321 (26-for-81) with runners in scoring position and had 14 sacrifice bunts, second on the club to Alcides Escobar's 18.   Getz was bumped off regular duty at second base with the arrival of Johnny Giavotella from Triple-A Omaha on Aug. 5. Getz, who is stellar on defense, will challenge Giavotella for the job in Spring Training.   The agreement leaves five Royals players still on the arbitration list.
