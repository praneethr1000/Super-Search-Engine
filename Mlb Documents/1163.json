    "body": "ARLINGTON -- Looking for a chance to pitch for a playoff team, right-handed reliever Jason Frasor has agreed to a one-year, $1.5 million contract with the Rangers.  \"He's a proven veteran who brings a competitive presence to our bullpen,\" Rangers pro scouting director Josh Boyd said Thursday.  Frasor, 35, has spent almost his entire nine-year career with the Blue Jays, and he was 1-1 with a 4.12 ERA in 50 relief appearances for them in 2012. He averaged 10.9 strikeouts, 4.5 walks and 8.7 hits per nine innings. To make room for Frasor on the 40-man roster, Texas designated catcher Eli Whiteside for assignment. The Rangers currently have a full 40-man roster. T.R. Sullivan is a reporter for MLB.com. Read his blog, Postcards from Elysian Fields, and follow him on Twitter @Sullivan_Ranger.
