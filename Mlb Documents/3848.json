    "body": "PITTSBURGH -- The Pirates took steps in helping secure potential right-handed bullpen help on Monday by signing right-handers Elmer Dessens and Adam Bernero to Minor League contracts. Both contracts include an invitation to the team's Spring Training.  After trading Salomon Torres to Milwaukee, watching Shawn Chacon test the free agent waters and falling short in their bids for other available proven right-handed arms, the Pirates needed to address the lack of experienced right-handed options for the 'pen.  Dessens returns to Pittsburgh 10 years after last pitching in a Pirates uniform. The soon-to-be 37-year-old veteran broke into the Majors with the Pirates in 1996 and spent parts of three seasons primarily coming out of the bullpen for the team. Since then, Dessens has pitched for six other clubs, which included both the Rockies and Brewers last season. After posting a 3.56 ERA in 2005, Dessens' numbers slipped over the past two seasons. In 12 relief appearances for the Brewers last season, Dessens gave up 11 earned runs in 15 innings. He then finished the year in Colorado, where he allowed 16 earned runs in five starts.   \"Dessens adds some versatility to the staff since he has started before,\" general manager Neal Huntington said. \"Adding him doesn't stop our search for other bullpen help, but we expect him to help.\"   Bernero broke into the Majors with Detroit in 2000, though he didn't log substantial time until 2002, when he went 4-7 in 28 appearances (11 starts). After his tenure in Detroit, Bernero jumped around to four other teams before sitting out the 2007 season.   Huntington said that the team has a few other bullpen arms on their radar and expect to make some further additions soon. It appears unlikely, however, that Chacon remains one of those options, as the two sides are still far apart in terms of salary expectations.   Huntington also confirmed on Monday that Masumi Kuwata has told the Pirates that he will accept a Minor League contract and the team's invitation to Spring Training. Kuwata spent two months in the big leagues last year, allowing 22 earned runs in 21 innings of work before being designated for assignment.   Migrating south:  Five position players and 22 pitchers will take part in the team's mini-camp, which is set to begin Tuesday morning in Bradenton, Fla. With four days of workouts, conditioning drills and meetings planned, the mini-camp will give new manager John Russell and his staff their first look at a number of the team's pitchers.   \"Mini-camp is nothing more than a checkpoint,\" Huntington said when asked why he decided to implement the January workouts. \"It's a time to see where everyone is in terms of their offseason conditioning programs and to bring everyone together to one place when they would normally be spread out all over the country.\"   All but four of the 24 pitchers currently on the club's 40-man roster will be in attendance. Three of those pitchers not attending -- Franquelis Osoria, Juan Perez and Damaso Marte -- are currently pitching in the Dominican Winter League. Veteran Matt Morris will also be missing.   Joining the 22 pitchers will be catchers Ronny Paulino, Ryan Doumit and Michel Hernandez. Outfielders Kevin Thompson and Chris Duffy will also be in attendance.
