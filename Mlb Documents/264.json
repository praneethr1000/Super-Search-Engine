    "body": "CINCINNATI -- Former Expos and Orioles general manager Jim Beattie began his work Tuesday as the Reds' special advisor for new owner Bob Castellini. Beattie hoped it would lead to a long-term relationship with Castellini as the Reds' next GM.  \"Oh, yes. Bob knows that,\" Beattie said from Great American Ball Park. Castellini identified Beattie as a potential candidate for the job Monday after he announced the dismissal of former Cincinnati GM Dan O'Brien.  The only other known candidate to replace O'Brien is Reds baseball operations director Brad Kullman, who was named interim GM. Mark Sheldon is a reporter for MLB.com.
