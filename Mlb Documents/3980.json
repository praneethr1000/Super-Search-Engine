    "body": "The Rangers added speedy outfield depth to their Spring Training contingent by signing free agent Kyle Hudson to a Minor League contract that includes an invitation to Major League camp.  Hudson, 25, made the rare trip from Class A through to the next two levels of the Minor Leagues and finally to the Orioles, as he was called up in September last season. Hudson was designated for assignment by the Orioles on Jan. 13 and subsequently released on Jan. 19.  The Rangers are picking up a left-handed batter who combined to bat .296 with a .375 on-base percentage, 23 RBIs and 41 steals in 119 games on three Minor League levels in 2011. In September, Hudson went 4-for-28 in 14 big league games, including seven starts in right field and one in center. Hudson, the Orioles' fourth-round pick in the 2008 First-Year Player Draft, led the Carolina League with 40 steals at Class A Frederick in 2010. A 5-foot-11, 175-pound product of the University of Illinois, Hudson spent the majority of the 2011 season with Triple-A Norfolk, where he batted .297 with 26 steals and 39 runs in 68 games.   The Rangers will now have 17 non-roster invitees at Spring Training. John Schlegel is a national reporter for MLB.com.
