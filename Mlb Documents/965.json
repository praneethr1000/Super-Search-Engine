    "body": "PITTSBURGH -- After going all last season without a bench coach, the Pirates on Wednesday officially promoted the man who spent most of the year at manager Clint Hurdle's side. The Pirates named Dave Jauss their bench coach, one of several promotions within their baseball operations department. Jauss was simply a \"Major League coach\" last season, but he essentially performed the duties of a bench coach all year, just without the title. Jauss has been a part of Hurdle's staff since Oct. 31, 2012. After Jeff Banister left his post as the Bucs' bench coach to become the Rangers' manager, Jauss stepped up to provide Hurdle with his thoughts and recommendations, discussing moves and strategy in the clubhouse and dugout. Jauss had joined the Pirates earlier in 2012 as a special assistant to general manager Neal Huntington. This will be his 29th season in professional baseball. Additionally, the Pirates announced that Brad Fischer will retain his title as a Major League coach. Pittsburgh promoted several members of its front-office staff on Wednesday. Kevan Graves, formerly the director of baseball operations, is now an assistant general manager -- a title also held by Kyle Stark and Greg Smith. Will Lawton has been promoted from baseball operations assistant to assistant director of baseball operations. Sean Kelly will move from the position of \"fellow\" to assume Lawton's old role.
