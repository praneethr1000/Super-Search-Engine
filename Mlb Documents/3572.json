    "body": "DETROIT -- There's a new Motown sound, one Major League scout said Wednesday in a attempt to sell a marketing pitch. With the impending arrival of Prince Fielder to join Miguel Cabrera in the Tigers' lineup, that sound the crack of the bat.  The pop of the glove, understandably, isn't part of that.  Make no mistake, the Tigers' infield shift -- if that's how they ultimately fit their two sluggers onto the field at the same time -- is a marriage of convenience, designed to fit two of the game's greatest hitters into the same lineup without relegating either to designated hitter all the time. If the Tigers truly believed Cabrera could be a great third baseman, he would've moved over there long ago, or never moved to first. On the other hand, if the Tigers truly believed a Cabrera shift would be a surefire disaster, they would've concocted alternate plans with him before embarking on the deal. It might not have kept them from a long-term investment in Fielder, but it might have set up a heart-to-heart talk with either Cabrera or Fielder about the DH role.   Together the Tigers' corner infielders total more than 500 pounds. Sizewise, they present a commanding presence. Defensively, a respectable showing in the field is the key to making the combination work. A struggle could make the bunt into a weapon in the American League Central, and make the Tigers' long-term positioning a serious question.   For all the work Cabrera has put in to make himself into a decent first baseman, he has always liked third base. He calls it his \"natural position,\" a term he used with Venezuelan reporters on Tuesday. He had an enthusiasm about taking ground balls at third last fall, when the Tigers were making contingency plans for fitting Victor Martinez into the lineup without the DH had Detroit advanced to the World Series.   Cabrera has willpower in his favor. And for Cabrera, with willpower comes a strong work ethic. Whether that will be enough to take the rust off his frame remains to be seen. However, it's at least a foundation.   Cabrera hasn't played third base on a regular basis since 2007. He played third base for his first three weeks as a Tiger in 2008, then swapped places with Carlos Guillen.   Scouts who remember watching Cabrera back then remember the instincts of a former teenage shortstop. Get him to the ball, they argued, and he'll make plays. It's the process of getting there that's the task.   \"Very coordinated, long actions,\" one longtime National League talent evaluator said in a text message. \"Range will be very little.\"   That concern could be tested, he said, on backhanded plays down the line. Get him charging in on bunts, and he'll have to fire on the fly.   \"Footwork's OK,\" the scout continued. \"Arm's a plus. He'll be more of a stationary type who must work hard to get by.\"   Most Detroiters remember his five errors in 14 games at third base in 2008 before he traded spots with Guillen. In Florida, a slimmer Cabrera finished 20th out of 22 qualifying Major League third basemen in 2007 with a .941 fielding percentage. His 2.51 Range Factor -- putouts plus assists per nine innings -- ranked 14th. He was 13th out of 20 in fielding percentage in 2006, and 16th in range.   John Dewan, as part of his Fielding Bible, came up with a plus\/minus rating based on the number of plays a player makes above or below an average fielder would make at that position. The formula ranked Cabrera 31st and 33rd among qualifying third basemen in 2006 and '07, respectively, according to billjamesonline.com.   Surprisingly, however, his rankings were average to slightly above for handling bunts, and he had plenty of opportunities in those seasons.   Fangraphs.com archives stats for Ultimate Zone Rating, a measure used in sabermetrics to better compare defenders based on balls in the area and plays made, not just balls that fielders reached. Cabrera ranked 16th out of 21 third basemen in UZR in 2007, and 13th in 2006.   \"Cabrera will be average on balls he gets to,\" a National League advance scout said in a text message. \"Just his range will be very limited in both directions.\"   If Cabrera can be anywhere near average, the Tigers would have to be happy with the results. But the strength in Cabrera is his catching and throwing, not his range. Tigers shortstop Jhonny Peralta has a similar profile, aided last year by having rangy Brandon Inge at third and Ramon Santiago at second.   Though Cabrera made some impressive diving stops at first, especially to his right, he can't be expected to make all the stops Inge did at third over the past seven years. How many he can knock down, especially down the line, could make a big difference for a pitching staff that includes two ground-ball starters in Doug Fister and Rick Porcello, and potentially a third if top prospect Jacob Turner wins the open rotation spot.   Plugging in Fielder at first base would be more of a natural fit, having played his entire Major League career at first. The scouting reports are stronger than the specialized stats. In the above statistics, Fielder has ranked in the top half of Major League first baseman only once, in 2009, based on Ultimate Zone Rating. In some statistics, Cabrera outplayed him.   Give Fielder enough games at first base, one scout said, and he should be fine, though he added that Cabrera reads the ball better.   \"Prince is a better fielder than people give him credit,\" the advance scout said. \"He's actually very athletic and has good hands around the bag.\"   Bottom line, if the Tigers put Cabrera and Fielder at the corners, their limitations will likely be more about size and speed than coordination. They'll get tested, especially within the division, and they'll put some burden on the pitching staff. But they'll also get their chances to step to the plate, too.   \"Can debate it for sure,\" one scout said. \"Win now written all over it.\" Jason Beck is a reporter for MLB.com.
