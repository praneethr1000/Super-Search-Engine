    "body": "KANSAS CITY -- James Shields was dressed in black and fighting the flu, but the right-hander seemed like a healthy ray of sunshine to the folks attending Saturday's Royals FanFest.  Spirits were high, primarily due to Shields and the refurbished Royals rotation, as fans flocked to the Overland Park Convention Center.  \"We had a good turnout today, it was an amazing FanFest,\" Shields said. \"I think there was probably close to 10,000 people out there. The fans seem real excited about this year. I'm excited to be here.\" ",
