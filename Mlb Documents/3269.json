    "body": "KANSAS CITY -- Early arrivals at the Royals' Spring Training camp will have company this year -- the Kia Tigers.  The Tigers, 10-time champions of the Korean Baseball Organization in South Korea, will train at the Royals' complex at Surprise, Ariz., starting Monday through Feb. 19. The team will be housed in the Royals' Minor League facilities and train on the back fields at the complex.  The Tigers will share the complex during the week of Jan. 30 with the Royals Fantasy Camp. The Royals' spring camp officially opens on Feb. 20, when pitchers and catchers report, but most players begin workouts earlier on their own and, in fact, some are already busy at Surprise.
