    "body": "One of the great aspects of this game is the efficient way in which it recycles itself. Through over a century of history, Major League Baseball has seen so many distinguished people come and go, yet it has never failed to find replacements -- someone new to root for -- and a new face that somehow sets the bar even higher, no matter how unfathomable that may have previously seemed.  But the league has a tough task ahead of itself now that the calendar has flipped to 2011.  That's because 2010 wasn't just the Year of the Pitcher. It was also the Year of the Manager -- or, perhaps more accurately, the Year of the Departing Manager. By the time MLB ceremonially turns over a new leaf on Opening Day, 12 men will be guiding new teams, which is one shy of history. But what made 2010 so unforgettable in the managerial department isn't the numbers.   It's the faces.   A historic quartet voluntarily decided to walk away from a job they loved and excelled at this past season: Joe Torre, Bobby Cox, Lou Piniella and Cito Gaston. Two of them are sure-shot Hall of Famers -- the other two, Piniella and Gaston, can make very strong cases -- and the foursome's departure helped make this past season arguably the game's most memorable, with regards to the managerial landscape.   Commissioner Allan H. (Bud) Selig recognizes the historical ramifications of Torre, Cox, Piniella and Gaston all retiring together, so he decided to honor them during the Winter Meetings in Lake Buena Vista, Fla.   \"This is truly a historic gathering of the great managers that baseball has ever had,\" Selig said on Dec. 7. \"They're role models to all who aspire to manage in the big leagues.\"   Since 1902, the year after the debut of the American League, the most managerial changes from one Opening Day to the next has been 13, done in both 1992 and 2003, according to STATS LLC.   Twelve teams will open with different managers this spring than they started the previous season with: the Marlins (Edwin Rodriguez), Orioles (Buck Showalter), Royals (Ned Yost), Cubs (Mike Quade), Mariners (Eric Wedge), D-backs (Kirk Gibson), Pirates (Clint Hurdle), Braves (Fredi Gonzalez), Blue Jays (John Farrell), Brewers (Ron Roenicke), Dodgers (Don Mattingly) and Mets (Terry Collins).   That means there will be plenty of opportunities for more memorable careers and lasting legacies to be carved in this league. But it isn't hyperbole to say we'll never again see a group of managers like these leave the game at the same time.   Think about it:    Only six skippers in MLB history have ever managed in five different decades, and Cox and Torre are two of them.    Torre (1996, '98, '99 and 2000), Gaston ('92 and '93), Cox ('95) and Piniella ('90) combined to win eight World Series titles in an 11-year span.    Cox (No. 4), Torre (No. 5) and Piniella (No. 14) all rank in the top 15 in managerial victories.    The four of them have combined for 7,559 wins, 42 trips to the postseason, nine Manager of the Year Awards and 14 All-Star Games as skippers.   They combined to do something else, too.   \"For 51 years, I've had nothing but fun,\" Cox said earlier this offseason. \"There's a lot of anxiety involved, but it's always fun. The stress is always there as a manager and a player. But it's always been fun to get to the clubhouse, get that uniform on and get the troops going.\"   Now, as part of MLB's circle of life, a new batch of field generals will step in to get their troops going. And there's a lot to be excited about in that regard.   There's Mattingly finally getting a chance to take over for his long-time boss in Hollywood; Collins trying to make the Mets a perennial playoff team again; Gonzalez filling the shoes of his mentor in his home of Atlanta; Showalter, Yost, Wedge and Hurdle getting another crack with a new team and Rodriguez, Quade, Gibson, Farrell and Roenicke heading into their first full season as big league skippers.   They don't have Torre's rings, Cox's division titles, Gaston's reputation or Sweet Lou's charm.   But give them time.   \"I feel like I'm ready,\" Mattingly said upon being named Torre's replacement as Dodgers manager on Sept. 17. \"I have confidence in myself. I know people are going to question it. It's understandable. It's a belief in myself.\" Alden Gonzalez is a reporter for MLB.com and writes an MLBlog, Gonzo and 'The Show'.
