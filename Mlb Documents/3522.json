    "body": "LOS ANGELES -- National League Cy Young Award winner Clayton Kershaw is seeking a 2012 salary of $10 million, with the Dodgers offering $6.5 million, in numbers exchanged through the arbitration process on Tuesday.  Earlier in the day, the club signed outfielder Andre Ethier and first baseman James Loney to one-year contracts. Ethier received $10.95 million plus performance bonuses, while Loney received $6.375 million plus performance bonuses. Both players are represented by CAA.  If Kershaw's case goes to a hearing in February, a three-member panel of arbitrators will hear both sides present arguments and rebuttals, then choose one salary or the other. If Kershaw wins, he'll receive a salary 20 times larger than the $500,000 he made last year. However, negotiations can continue until then on a one-year or multiyear deal, and only a handful of cases each year go to a hearing. Ken Gurnick is a reporter for MLB.com.
