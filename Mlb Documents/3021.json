    "body": "DENVER -- The Rockies' potential Opening Day rotation is full of mysteries and questions, thanks to an exciting -- if unproven -- set of hurlers either obtained in recent trades or developed by the farm system.  Then, there is right-hander Jason Hammel, who is heading into his fourth season with the club at age 29 but is still a mysterious figure, especially after his confounding performance in 2011.  After a strong first month, Hammel was so inconsistent over the next four months that he pitched his way out of the rotation. But in his final seven appearances -- five relief outings and two starts -- Hammel displayed a greater efficiency and consistency than at any point since joining the club in early 2009.
