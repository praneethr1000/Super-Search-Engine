    "body": "HOUSTON -- Roger Clemens is not under contract to pitch for the Houston Astros this year, but it was just like old times when the Rocket threw batting practice to the club's top prospects as part of the Nolan Ryan Elite Camp on Monday at Minute Maid Park.  Clemens, donning an Astros T-shirt and cap, threw for approximately 30 minutes to a number of young hitters, including his son, Koby, who is a third baseman in the Astros farm system. Clemens spent much of the morning in the bullpen with the pitching prospects who are in town for the week-long mini-camp, directed by Ryan, manager Phil Garner and general manager Tim Purpura.  Clemens is still unsure about his plans for 2006. Beyond testing his arm, back and hamstrings to see if he's up for competing in the World Baseball Classic, Clemens has little to say about April and beyond. If he knows what he wants to do, he's not giving any hints. Clemens has committed to being with the U.S. team in the WBC in some capacity. He'd like to pitch, but if he feels that he's physically unable to do so by early March, he will probably serve as an ambassador of sorts.   \"My legs, my body feel great,\" Clemens said. \"My arm feels good. I just need my conditioning with my legs. When I have a little extra-long session here, I was able to throw [batting practice] and simulate a couple hitters, it really helps a lot.\"  Clemens hopes to tell U.S. manager Buck Martinez about his status for the WBC in a little less than two weeks.  \"Hopefully, within 12 days or so, I'll be able to call Buck and tell him I'm ready to go, or [if] I'm going to go out there and swing a flag and cheerlead,\" he said.  The more pressing issue for fans, of course, is not the WBC but whether Clemens will sign with Houston after May 1, when the two sides can begin negotiating. The Astros are believed to be the favorite to sign Clemens, who will begin a 10-year personal-services contract with the Astros upon his final retirement.   But the Yankees, Red Sox and Rangers are also interested in the Rocket, and Rangers owner Tom Hicks hasn't been shy about his desire to have the future Hall of Famer and native Texan pitching in Arlington in 2006.   \"I have a lot of respect for him,\" said Clemens of Hicks. \"We've had great visits many times. I don't worry about that. The Hendricks [Clemens' agents] will handle that part of it. If I decide to play [in Houston], I know I can't play here until after May. If I want to get started right away, I know I can't do that here. Those will be my options. It's just the way it is.\"  The notion of Clemens bolting for the Rangers has sent a chill up the spines of most Astros fans, who still haven't forgotten the day when Ryan, spurned by former owner John McMullen, signed with the Rangers more than a decade and a half ago.   Ryan, who is in the middle of his own personal-services contract with Houston, surmises that Clemens will pitch again in 2006, and said that he wouldn't rule out the Rangers as a realistic suitor.   \"Tom's always wanted Roger,\" said Ryan. \"When I was with the Rangers and Roger had retired from the Yankess, Tom's goal was to try to sign him. I think he feels Roger brings something to the Rangers that you don't find very often. That doesn't surprise me, because in all those people's minds, Roger's still capable of contributing, and that's why we're hearing that.   \"They feel like they have as good a shot as anybody -- outside the Astros -- of Roger, if he were to not work in Houston, to go to Arlington. I think they probably feel like they would be the No. 1 contigent.\"  Asked if he viewed the Rangers as a legitimate threat, Ryan responded, \"Yeah, I do.\"  Clemens was less pointed with his comments.  \"Nolan pitched for a long time, and if there's anybody who knows your body and knows how you feel ...\" Clemens said. \"He asked me the same question, and I told him, 'There will be a week that I get up and I feel like I can do it again, and the next week, I don't want to get in the outfield and start running these poles.'  \"If last year's World Series was it for me, I'll be more than happy. It was a lot of fun. I know we didn't reach our ultimate goal, but it was a lot of fun. I have a lot to think about on that.\"  In the meantime, Clemens is content to serve as a coach this week at the mini-camp.  \"This is my home,\" he said. \"Whether I play here or not, no matter what, I'm going to come back here and work with these kids. I'm going to be around the organization. That's why we worked so hard with Drayton [McLane] to get that [personal services] deal done.  \"I'll go out and shake hands and enjoy the fans that come to the games, but I want to work with the kids behind the scenes in the Minor Leagues. I love doing that. Right now, that's the only deal I've got.\"   Alyson Footer is a reporter for MLB.com. This story was not subject to the approval of Major League Baseball or its clubs.",
