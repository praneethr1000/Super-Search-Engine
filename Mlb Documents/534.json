    "body": "MILWAUKEE -- The Brewers' flagship radio station has dramatically shortened the list of potential replacements for departed play-by-play man Jim Powell and could be down to a single finalist. The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported Friday that the field was down to two -- Chicago's Cory Provus and Arizona's Jeff Munn. Both men host pre- and post-game radio shows and do occasional play-by-play for their club's network of radio affiliates, and would be moving to a higher-profile position as Milwaukee's No. 2 radio voice.  MLB.com subsequently learned that Munn was out, leaving Provus, a 2000 graduate of Syracuse University, as the leading contender to join Bob Uecker in the Brewers' radio booth.
