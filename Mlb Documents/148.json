    "body": "He was supposed to be a strikeout king for the ages. Instead, he became a cautionary tale about human frailty and the perils of instant stardom.  Every December, when the Hall of Fame ballot arrives, there is particular pleasure in reviewing the first-year candidates. The vast majority of them will never be inducted into the Hall, but these are all careers of substance, guaranteed to produce distinctly positive recollections.  There is one name on this year's ballot that does not produce any warm and fuzzy associations. That would be the name of Dwight Gooden. In viewing this candidacy, there is mostly sadness. Dwight Gooden was one of the most magnificently talented pitchers anyone has ever seen. But he will not be going to Cooperstown, unless the National Baseball Hall of Fame opens a What-Should-Have-Been wing. Mike Bauman is a national columnist for MLB.com.
