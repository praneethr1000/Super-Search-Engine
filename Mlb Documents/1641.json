    "body": "Free-agent infielder Bill Hall has agreed to a Minor League deal with the Angels on Wednesday and will receive an invitation to the club's Major League Spring Training. The deal was first reported by Ken Rosenthal of FOXSports.com. Hall spent most of 2012 with Baltimore's Triple-A affiliate, Norfolk, where he hit .246 with 15 homers in 90 games. In just seven games for the big league club, Hall notched two hits in nine at-bats. Defensively, Hall played just about everywhere. Between Triple-A and the Majors, he played all four infield positions and both left and right field. With Norfolk, however, he spent the majority of his time at second base (27 games) and third base (26 games). Hall has played for six big league clubs, but spent his first seven-plus seasons with Milwaukee. He is a lifetime .248 hitter with 125 home runs, a .308 on-base percentage and a .436 slugging percentage. AJ Cassavell is a reporter for MLB.com.
