    "body": "The members of the northern leg of the 2012 Reds Caravan pulled into their final stop, the National Museum of the United States Air Force in Dayton, Ohio, tired but exhilarated. As Reds director of media relations Rob Butcher put it: \"It's a very hectic three or four days. Physically, it's tough on you. But then, you get to the venues and you see the place is full.\" Reds general manager Walt Jocketty and catcher Devin Mesoraco echoed that sentiment. \"Seeing the young kids that come out and begin their relationship as a Reds fan is always fun to watch,\" said Jocketty.  \"It is always fun just to go out and see the new places and see some of the fans in Reds Country,\" said Mesoraco, who wrapped up his third Caravan. \"There have been a lot of young kids at the stops and to put a smile on a young kid's face is very enjoyable for me.\"  \"The Reds have always been a regional team, not just a city team,\" said Reds COO Phil Castellini. \"So we get out there and see fans from all over Reds Country. The primary focus is to make sure that all of those fans in all of those cities within a couple hundred-mile radius of Cincinnati know that we appreciate them supporting the team.\"  Castellini said fan input has largely been positive.  \"[Fans] really follow the team and know what Walt has been doing, and they have been insightful as to the trades,\" said Castellini. \"They recognize that we have had to give some things up to get the new players. But I think people understand what we are doing, and they are ready to support the team.\"  Mesoraco said one of his favorite parts of the Caravan experience is bonding with his fellow Reds.  \"The time on the bus is pretty special,\" said Mesoraco. \"[I enjoy] watching movies and hanging out with guys that I haven't had an opportunity to spend time with in the past.\"  Castellini hoped the Caravan was a learning experience for fans and Reds players alike. He hopes the team gains \"an appreciation for how hard the fans work and support their team, and travel a lot of distance to get to Cincinnati and watch them play. It makes the players respect the game and what they are doing for the fans.\"  Butcher said planning the Caravan is a huge undertaking, mainly on the part of director of promotional events Zach Bonkowski, better known as @Bongreatness on Twitter.  \"He plans each stop -- every radio stop, every hotel stop, every dinner stop. It takes him the entire offseason,\" Butcher said. \"Once Redsfest is over, he devotes the next two months to the caravan.\"  And for good reason -- the Caravan's three legs traveled a total of 2,800 miles. Each leg had an entourage of 18-20 staffers tagging along. In addition to players, broadcasters and front-office personnel, representatives from the Reds Hall of Fame, Caravan sponsor CincinnatiUSA.com, and a venue set-up crew were all on hand.  Fans were given the opportunity to get autographs and photos with players, as well as the chance to ask a question to players and personnel during a Q&A session at each stop.  Butcher, who described the Caravan as \"Redsfest on wheels,\" said the Caravan has a very specific goal.  \"We try to be as personal as possible and get our fans to meet the players, because if you personally like the players, you're more likely to come and watch them play,\" Butcher said. \"At this time of year, we're just trying to get people excited about Reds baseball again.\"  Judging by the mob of over 500 who showed up at the Air Force museum, mission accomplished.
