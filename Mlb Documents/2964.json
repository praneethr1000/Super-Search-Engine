    "body": "ANAHEIM -- Angels Minor League pitcher Daniel Reynolds received a 50-game suspension after a second violation for a \"drug of abuse\" under the Minor League Drug Prevention and Treatment Program, Major League Baseball announced Tuesday.  Reynolds, a 20-year-old right-hander who has spent the last two years pitching for the Rookie-level Orem Owlz, will begin serving his suspension at the start of the upcoming regular season.  A Las Vegas native who was taken in the sixth round of the 2009 First-Year Player Draft, Reynolds made just four relief appearances in 2010, then pitched in 20 games in 2011 -- posting a 4.60 ERA and a 1.295 WHIP in 29 1\/3 innings.
