    "body": "HOUSTON -- As a kid growing up in Long Island, N.Y., Craig Biggio did not root for a particular Major League team, but he did idolize one player in particular -- Yankees catcher Thurman Munson. So it's probably only fitting that the longtime Astros favorite should cap his illustrious 20-year career by receiving an honor named after his favorite player. Biggio will do just that on Feb. 5, when he will be presented with the Thurman Munson Award for excellence in competition and philanthropic work within the community.  Biggio is one of five sports stars who will be presented with \"Thurmans.\" Mets third baseman David Wright, Yankees center fielder Melky Cabrera, New York Knicks sharpshooter Jamal Crawford and Olympic gold medal-winning figure skater Kristi Yamaguchi will also be recognized at 28th annual Thurman Munson Awards Dinner at the Marriott Marquis Hotel in New York City. The AHRC New York City Foundation benefits from the gala, which remembers Munson, the late, great Yankees catcher and captain who died tragically in a 1979 plane crash.   Diana Munson, Thurman's widow, has been involved in the benefit since its inception, raising nearly $8 million to assist children and adults with developmental disabilities.  Len Berman of NBC Sports will serve as the master of ceremonies.   Biggio, 42, recently completed two decades of service to the Astros and Major League Baseball, during which he set franchise records with 3,060 hits, 668 doubles and 2,850 games played. His hit total ranks 20th all-time, and he has more doubles than any right-handed hitter in history.  But Biggio is as well-known for his community efforts as he is for his on-field accomplishments. The seven-time All-Star is actively involved with the Sunshine Kids, a support group for kids with cancer and their families. He raised more than $2.5 million for the organization throughout his career by hosting several fundraising events, including his annual Sunshine Kids celebrity golf tournament.   He also hosted an annual baseball party at Minute Maid Park, where more than 100 children with cancer played baseball on the field, with Biggio serving as the pitcher. He and his wife, Patty, also hosted a holiday party at the Sunshine Kids house, which the Biggios helped restore and furnish.   In 2006, Biggio was the recipient of the \"Heart and Hustle\" Award, which honors a player who excels on the field but also \"best embodies the values, spirit and traditions of the game.\"   In 2005, Biggio received the Hutch Award, given annually by the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center. In 2007, he received the highest off-the-field honor in baseball -- the Roberto Clemente Award, which recognizes sportsmanship, community involvement and the individual's contribution to his team.  The Munson Awards Dinner has previously honored such notables as Willie Randolph, Mariano Rivera, Muhammad Ali, Yogi Berra, Goose Gossage, Don Mattingly, Jorge Posada, Joe Torre, Patrick Ewing, Bernie Williams, Arthur Ashe, Willis Reed, Earl Monroe, Willie Mays, Mark Messier, Mike Richter, Tom Seaver and John Franco, just to name a few.  The AHRC New York City Foundation is a not-for-profit organization that supports programs enabling children and adults with developmental disabilities to lead richer, more productive lives, including programs of AHRC New York City. AHRC New York City is one of the largest organizations of its kind, serving 11,000 children and adults who have mental retardation, autism, cerebral palsy, traumatic brain injuries and other developmental disabilities.
