    "body": "HOUSTON -- Jeff Bagwell will fly to Birmingham, Ala., on Thursday to meet with noted orthopedic surgeon Dr. James Andrews, Astros GM Tim Purpura confirmed on Tuesday. Bagwell was tentatively scheduled for the Thursday appointment until it was revealed that Dr. Andrews suffered a heart attack over the weekend. Apparently, the surgeon has been cleared to meet with Bagwell, who could benefit from ideas Dr. Andrews might have regarding the first baseman's rehab of his right shoulder. Bagwell has been on a strict rehab regimen since his June surgery that released the capsule around his shoulder, but he curbed the intensity of the routine in order to come back early as a pinch-hitter last September. Once the World Series was over, Bagwell resumed his exercise schedule, which includes several exercises designed to build the muscles in and around his rotator cuff that lost strength over the past several years.  The meeting with Dr. Andrews is nothing more than a consulation, during which he may have some new ideas in terms of helping Bagwell with his throwing.   \"We don't expect anything earth-shattering to come out of this,\" Purpura said. \"He's not going to be determined 100 percent healthy or 100 percent that he can't play. That would be unrealistic. This is nothing more than an evaluation.\" Alyson Footer is a reporter for MLB.com. This story was not subject to the approval of Major League Baseball or its clubs.",
