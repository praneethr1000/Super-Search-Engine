    "body": "KANSAS CITY -- This year's Royals Caravan will have a slightly different spin -- instead of players, fans will get to see and photograph the Royals' World Series trophy in what will officially be called the Trophy Tour. Beginning Feb. 8, the Trophy Tour, presented by the Missouri Lottery and the Kansas Lottery, will embark on visits to communities throughout the Midwest. The tour will make several stops in cities across Kansas, Missouri, Iowa and Nebraska. Fans can see the trophy in person at each stop during a specified two-hour period on a first-come, first-served basis. In order to accommodate as many people as possible, photo opportunities will only be available as either an individual or group shot. Fans will also have the opportunity to have a professional photo taken and can purchase those photos on-site and online at royals.com. A portion of all professional photo purchases benefit Royals Charities. At select stops, the trophy will be joined by Sluggerrr and KayCee, the Royals Hall of Fame baseball character. The Trophy Tour follows Royals FanFest, which will take place on Friday and Saturday at Bartle Hall at the Kansas City Convention Center. FanFest will feature appearances by current and former Royals, interactive games for fans of all ages, main stage events and more. A schedule of the Trophy Tour stops are listed at royals.com\/trophytour. Jeffrey Flanagan is a reporter for MLB.com. Follow him on Twitter at @FlannyMLB.
