    "body": "SAN FRANCISCO -- If America really is the land of opportunity, then Ryan Vogelsong is an ideal choice for Team USA. The Giants right-hander has committed to play for the United States in the World Baseball Classic, joining a provisional roster that includes a pitching staff with stars such as Toronto's R.A. Dickey, Atlanta's Craig Kimbrel and the Yankees' Andy Pettitte. The full roster will be named on Thursday. Just two years ago, Vogelsong was a non-roster Spring Training invitee to the Giants' camp, attempting to return to the Major Leagues after four years of performing in Japan and Triple-A. Not only did Vogelsong succeed, but he also made the National League All-Star team that year and followed in 2012 with a 14-9 regular-season record and a 3-0 mark with a 1.09 ERA in four postseason starts. \"This was really a tough decision for me because I feel like my loyalty should be to the organization and my teammates first -- to be as well-prepared for the season as I can,\" he said. \"It wasn't an overnight decision.\"     Chris Haft is a reporter for MLB.com.
