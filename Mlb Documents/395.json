    "body": "WASHINGTON -- The Nationals exchanged salary arbitration figures with second baseman Alfonso Soriano on Tuesday.  The parties are $2 million apart. The Nationals are offering $10 million, while Soriano is looking for a $12 million payday. Last season, Soriano made $7.5 million and hit .268 with 36 home runs and 104 RBIs for the Rangers.  The Nationals acquired the right-handed-hitting Soriano from Texas in December for outfielders Brad Wilkerson and Terrmel Sledge and right-handed pitcher Armando Galarraga. Arbitration hearings are scheduled for February, but Washington and Soriano can settle on a contract anytime prior to the player's hearing.   Nationals general manager Jim Bowden said that he will settle Soriano's contract situation with agent Diego Bentz before addressing the fact that Soriano does not want to switch from second base to the outfield.   \"Diego and I have agreed that we are going to attempt to do the contract before we continue to the second issue,\" Bowden said. \"[The position switch] is a very sensitive issue with Alfonso. We respect him, we respect his opinions and we respect his baseball abilities as a player. That will show with our contract with him or arbitration case with him.   \"We don't want it to be a soap opera through the media. ... We are also very sensitive to how we can build a baseball team the best way we possibly can. We usually care about the name in front of the jersey more than the back of the jersey. That's what it's all about.\"  Bill Ladson is a reporter for MLB.com. This story was not subject to the approval of Major League Baseball or its clubs.",
