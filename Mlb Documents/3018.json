    "body": "Aaron Cook, the starting pitcher the Red Sox defeated in the decisive win of the 2007 World Series, has agreed to join Boston on a Minor League deal, according to multiple reports Sunday night. Cook, who turns 33 in February, finished a three-year, $29.5 million deal with the Rockies with one of the worst seasons of his career, as health issues again plagued him. The right-hander did not pitch in a big league game last year until June because of shoulder issues and a freak accident with a door that broke a finger on his throwing hand.  Cook went 3-10 with a 6.03 ERA in 97 innings, striking out 48 while walking 37. If Cook can put together a bounce-back effort, it would give the Red Sox some much-needed starting pitching depth.   Colorado is the only Major League organization Cook has played for, pitching in the big leagues for the last 10 seasons after being drafted in the second round in 1997.   Besides Cook's loss to the Red Sox in Game 4 of the '07 Fall Classic -- he let up three earned runs on three hits over six innings in Boston's 4-3 win -- there is some familiarity for both parties. New Sox pitching coach Bob McClure worked in the Rockies' organization from 1999-2005.   Lifetime, Cook is 72-68 with a 4.53 ERA in 238 appearances (206 starts). He's been a full-time starter since pitching mostly out of the bullpen in 2003, his sophomore season.  Evan Drellich is a reporter for MLB.com. Follow him on Twitter @EvanDrellich.
