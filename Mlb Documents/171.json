    "body": "PITTSBURGH -- The Pittsburgh Pirates appear to be on the verge of adding the power bat that they have been pursuing for the past two offseasons.  According to sources familiar with the negotiations, the Pirates are close to signing free agent outfielder Jeromy Burnitz to a one-year deal believed to be worth $6 million with a mutual option for 2007. The club is expected to make an official announcement later this week upon Burnitz's completion of a team physical.  Burnitz would fill the Pirates' need for a left-handed hitting power hitter in the middle of their lineup. In 13 big league seasons with the Mets, Indians, Brewers, Dodgers, Rockies and Cubs, Burnitz has a career .255 batting average with 299 home runs and 932 RBIs. He has hit 24 or more home runs on eight different occasions in his career, including last season, when he batted .258 with 24 home runs and 87 RBIs with the Chicago Cubs.
