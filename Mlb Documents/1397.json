    "body": "ARLINGTON -- Joakim Soria said he signed with the Rangers because he wanted a place to pitch. He was a closer for five seasons for the Royals but understands that might not be his role with the Rangers.  Joe Nathan is the Rangers' closer for 2013 and possibly '14 if the club picks up his option. That seems to be fine with Soria, although he still entertains hopes of being a closer again at some point in his career.  \"This is baseball,\" Soria said. \"I just love to play baseball. I don't mind if I'm the setup reliever. The goal is to win the championship.\" T.R. Sullivan is a reporter for MLB.com.
