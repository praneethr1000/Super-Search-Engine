    "body": "MILWAUKEE -- His first big contract apparently is not going to change Matt Wise. Shortly after agreeing to a two-year, $1.7 million contract to return to the Milwaukee Brewers, he went out to dinner with his wife and paid with a gift card. \"I guess nothing changes,\" Wise joked. The Brewers avoided salary arbitration with their top returning setup man late Thursday, signing Wise to a two-year contract that buys out his first two seasons of arbitration eligibility. He will earn $700,000 in 2006 and $1 million in 2007. Ash said he expects newly re-acquired right-hander Dan Kolb to handle the bulk of setup duties, leaving Wise free to pitch the middle innings. Hard-throwing right-hander Jose Capellan is another candidate to share that role.         Adam McCalvy is a reporter for MLB.com.
