    "body": "Ozzie Guillen has yet to make his first decision in the dugout for the Miami Marlins, and his seat already is rather toasty.  Well, it's at least warm.  Listen closely, and imagine the temperature rising around this guy, and not because of the South Florida sun. Soon after the Marlins became the latest to suggest that up is down, pigs fly and baseballs are square by acquiring the historically volatile Carlos Zambrano, Marlins president of baseball operations Larry Beinfest told reporters, \"We went with Ozzie on this one.\"   That's \"we,\" as in the decision makers of the Marlins, and that's \"Ozzie,\" as in their new manager.   Guillen convinced his bosses that adding Zambrano's occasionally impressive right arm to their starting rotation was more significant than the right-hander's tendency to implode -- as a pitcher and as a person.   Added Beinfest to reporters, \"Ozzie has a long and close relationship with Carlos. ... The bottom line was Ozzie just really, really felt confident about this deal.\"   To paraphrase Beinfest's message to Ozzie: This better work.   If history has the answer, it likely won't.   Ask Jim Hendry.   Hendry is the former general manager of the Chicago Cubs, and much of the reason he isn't their current GM is because he decided Milton Bradley wouldn't become Milton Bradley.   As a result, prior to the 2009 season, Hendry ignored the slew of controversies involving Bradley during his previous nine seasons in the Major Leagues with six different teams, and he signed the outfielder to a three-year contract worth $30 million.   Bradley lasted one season with the Cubs.   It was amazing he lasted that long.   In addition to Bradley's struggles at the plate that led to a .257 batting average, 12 home runs and 40 RBIs, then-Cubs manager Lou Piniella blasted Bradley during a team meeting.   Two things followed: Hendry somehow discovered a seventh team (the Seattle Mariners) that didn't expect Bradley to become Bradley, and Hendry worked a trade after the season. Then Bradley spent the spring of 2010 ripping everything involving the Cubs.   Even their famously loyal fans.   I was there that day at the Cubs' Spring Training home in Mesa, Ariz., when Hendry first heard about Bradley's tirade. Said Hendry, \"It was a one-year situation that I brought him to try to help us from the left side [of the plate]. Obviously it was a mistake.\" Obviously. In fact, it \"obviously\" wasn't the wise thing to do, even before Hendry did it.   The same went for baseball executives who took their chances in the past with a Dave Kingman or an Albert Belle. And, most recently, you had the Los Angeles Dodgers officials convincing themselves that \"Manny being Manny\" was just East Coast hype.   So, despite well-chronicled stories of Manny Ramirez giving less than his best running out grounders and chasing fly balls between overall silliness that included phantom injuries, the Dodgers worked a trade in July 2008 to get Ramirez from the Boston Red Sox.   It was great ... in the beginning.   Ramirez was so popular with the Dodgers that management dedicated a section of seats to him at Dodger Stadium called \"Mannywood.\" In that area, fans could spend $99 -- his number with the Dodgers -- for a couple of tickets and two T-shirts. He helped them surge to a National League West title before they lost in the NLCS.   After the season, the Dodgers even signed the free-agent Ramirez to a two-year contract worth $45 million, but it quickly evolved into Manny being Manny again.   There was Ramirez's 50-game suspension for violating Major League Baseball's substance abuse policy, and there were his frequent trips to the disabled list. Finally, there was the Dodgers getting rid of Ramirez in August 2010, before the end of his contract.   Even so, Ramirez played two more seasons after that before he was suspended 100 games last year with the Tampa Bay Rays for another substance abuse violation. Prior to that, after Ramirez was cut by the Dodgers, he was claimed on waivers by the Chicago White Sox to finish the rest of that 2010 season.   The White Sox's manager at the time?   Guillen.   No question, Guillen likes Zambrano.   There was much to like during Zambrano's 11 seasons with the Cubs along the way to a 125-81 record. It's just that he often battled teammates and common sense as well as opponents.   Last August, after Zambrano allowed five home runs in Atlanta during a game against the Braves, he headed to the visitors' clubhouse, cleaned out his locker and bolted the team. Courtesy of that, combined with a rising 4.82 ERA to complement a sinking 9-7 record, Zambrano was suspended by the Cubs for the rest of the season.   The year before that, Zambrano exploded in the Cubs' dugout during a game at Wrigley Field against the Chicago White Sox. His target was normally mild teammate Derrek Lee, and Piniella was not amused. He sent Zambrano home for reflection, but the pitcher didn't stay there long.   To the dismay of Piniella, Zambrano went dining that evening with the White Sox manager ... Guillen.   Zambrano and Guillen are natives of Venezuela, and they are so close that Guillen tells folks that they exchange text messages almost daily. They also both are noted for saying and doing things that make those around them wish to go screaming into the night.   Still, they both are talented enough to make others gamble on them.   Which means the Marlins hope they haven't rolled snake eyes: Twice.  Terence Moore is a columnist for MLB.com. This story was not subject to the approval of Major League Baseball or its clubs.",
