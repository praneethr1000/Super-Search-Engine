    "body": "PARADISE VALLEY, Ariz. -- Approval of Jeff Moorad's purchase of the Padres was tabled on Thursday as owners asked for clarification on several outstanding financial issues, Commissioner Bud Selig said.  \"There were a lot of economic concerns,\" Selig said after completion of the first quarterly ownership meeting of the year. \"The most important thing we do is bringing in new owners, so we have really become very fastidious about whether people can [financially] make it. I'm not suggesting there's anything negative. There were just questions that we didn't have time to answer here. But that's where we are and we're going to do that as expeditiously as possible.\"  The 100 percent sale of the franchise -- at an estimated $530 million -- that Padres chairman John Moores has owned since late 1995 was pulled from the agenda midway through the meeting because Moorad couldn't immediately generate answers to the questions posed to him through the ownership committee and executive council.
