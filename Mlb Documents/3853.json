    "body": "A battery that hasn't been used in more than a year powers up again next month in Peoria, Ariz., when Mariners pitchers and catchers report for Spring Training.  Knuckleball specialist R.A. Dickey, acquired from the Twins in the Rule 5 Draft during the Winter Meetings, will be among the pitchers in camp. And, it turns out, so will the catcher Dickey worked with in 2006, when the veteran right-hander began mastering the knuckleball.  That would be Jamie Burke. Jim Street is a reporter for MLB.com.
