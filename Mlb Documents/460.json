    "body": "NEW YORK -- Jorge Julio agreed Friday to a $2,525,000, one-year contract with the Mets, who acquired him six days earlier from the Orioles, enabling the club to avoid a salary arbitration case for the 14th straight year.  In an effort to reinforce their bullpen, the Mets dealt Kris Benson to the Orioles for Julio and right-handed Minor League starter John Maine, and, in the process, they inherited a potential arbitration case and the proposed salary, $2.3 million, the Orioles had submitted for the case. Julio, who earned $2.5 million in 2005, had submitted a proposal for $2.8 million.  Having lost the Orioles' closer assignment to B.J. Ryan, Julio produced a 3-5 record and 5.90 ERA in 67 appearances and a career-high 72 2\/3 innings. Marty Noble is a reporter for MLB.com.
