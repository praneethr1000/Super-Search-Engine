The budding young superstar scoffed when a reporter suggested such during a conference call with the media on Wednesday afternoon.  \"I think I don't know how you would get a sense of that,\" Teixeira said. \"This is the first real time we've talked to the media or anybody about the World Baseball Classic. If it's up to me, I want to win these games more than anybody. Every player wants to win no matter what, and when you put us up against the best players in world, we want to win even more.\" Damon, who batted .316 last year for the Red Sox and will take over in Yankee Stadium's spacious center field this year, said the USA roster is so loaded that he's not sure he would be a starter.",
