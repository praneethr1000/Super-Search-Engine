    "body": "BOSTON -- The Red Sox's coaching staff isn't quite set. Well-respected bullpen coach Gary Tuck, who was to be the only holdover on the staff from a year ago, has decided to retire, according to the Red Sox. Tuck, 58 and an Indiana resident, would've entered his seventh season as the Sox's bullpen coach. Boston's Minor League catching coordinator, Chad Epperson, could be a candidate to fill Tuck's job. Tuck has coached or scouted for seven teams that have reached the World Series, with five of those clubs winning titles. He spent a long time with the Yankees before joining the Sox, and has also worked with the Astros, Indians and Marlins. WEEI.com first reported on Tuesday that Tuck would not return for the 2013 season. Evan Drellich is a reporter for MLB.com. Follow him on Twitter @EvanDrellich.
