    "body": "NEW YORK -- Standout All-Star reliever Dellin Betances and perennial fan favorite Bernie Williams have been announced among the honorees for the 35th annual Thurman Munson Awards dinner, which is scheduled to be held on Feb. 3 at the Grand Hyatt Hotel in New York. Also in line to receive Munson Awards, presented for success on the field of play and philanthropic works off the field, are former big league outfielder Mookie Wilson, Olympic gold medal-winning ice dancers Meryl Davis and Charlie White and Giants Super Bowl-champion punter Steve Weatherford. Joel S. Isaacson, the founder and CEO of Joel Isaacson & Co., will receive the Business & Philanthropic Leadership Award. The awards and dinner pay homage to the late Yankees captain, whose life was tragically cut short by a plane crash on Aug. 2, 1979. The event benefits the AHRC NYC Foundation, a not-for-profit organization that supports programs enabling children and adults with intellectual and developmental disabilities. Diana Munson, Thurman's widow, will attend her 35th straight benefit. She has been involved since its inception, raising more than $13 million. AHRC NYC is one of the largest organizations of its kind, serving 15,000 children and adults who have intellectual and developmental disabilities, including autism, cerebral palsy, traumatic brain injuries and other disabilities.
