    "body": "MILWAUKEE -- The Brewers and left-hander Manny Parra struck an agreement on a one-year contract Thursday, avoiding arbitration.  Parra did not pitch in the Major Leagues in 2011 because of back and elbow injuries, and underwent surgery in late August to remove a spur from his elbow. He earned $1.2 million last season after being arbitration-eligible for the first time, and a source said Parra would earn the same salary in 2012.  The fact the Brewers opted to tender Parra a contract in December indicated they feel he can contribute in 2012. The former top prospect found success after moving into a relief role in 2010, posting a 2.39 ERA, a .252 opponents' average and a nearly three-to-one strikeout-to-walk ratio in 26 appearances out of the bullpen. Parra was slated to be a key bullpen piece in 2011 before a back injury derailed his Spring Training. Adam McCalvy is a reporter for MLB.com.
