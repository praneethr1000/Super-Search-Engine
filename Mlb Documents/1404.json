    "body": "BALTIMORE -- The Orioles came to terms with right-hander Tommy Hunter on Monday afternoon, agreeing to a one-year, $1.82 million contract for 2013 that allows the two sides to avoid arbitration.  The 26-year-old Hunter, arbitration-eligible for the first time, was projected to make $1.8 million, per MLB Trade Rumors, and is coming off a season in which he went 7-8 with a 5.45 ERA in 33 games (20 starts). He flourished as a reliever, going 3-0 with a 0.71 ERA in his final 10 appearances.  The Orioles now have seven arbitration-eligible players: catcher Matt Wieters, infielder Chris Davis, left-handers Troy Patton and Brian Matusz, and right-handers Jason Hammel, Jim Johnson and Darren O'Day.
