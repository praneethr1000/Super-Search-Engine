    "body": "A total of 142 players filed for salary arbitration, as announced Friday by the Major League Baseball Players Association.  The arbitration filing period ran from Jan. 5 until Friday, with Jan. 17 set as the day for salary arbitration figures to be exchanged. Those players and teams who actually go to hearings will engage in that process from Feb. 1-21 in St. Petersburg, Fla.  San Diego easily topped the list with 11 players who filed, including Luke Gregerson, Chase Headley, Carlos Quentin, Clayton Richard, Tim Stauffer, Will Venable and Edinson Volquez. The Red Sox were next with eight, as their list included Alfredo Aceves, Daniel Bard, Andrew Bailey, Jacoby Ellsbury, David Ortiz and Jarrod Saltalamacchia. The Red Sox had offered arbitration to the free agent Ortiz, and he accepted. The same holds true for Blue Jays second baseman Kelly Johnson and Brewers setup man Francisco Rodriguez. The Indians, Royals, Cubs, Giants and Nationals each had seven players file. Among the more prominent names to file was San Francisco starter Tim Lincecum, who earned $13 million in 2011 in the second year of a two-year, $23-million deal. Also on the list were the Dodgers' Clayton Kershaw, who won the 2011 National League Cy Young Award, and Andre Ethier.   The Royals who filed were pitchers Luke Hochevar, Jonathan Sanchez and Felipe Paulino; catcher Brayan Pena; infielder Chris Getz and outfielders Alex Gordon and Mitch Maier.   Atlanta outfielder Michael Bourn, Baltimore outfielder Adam Jones, Chicago Cubs pitcher Matt Garza, Cleveland infielder Asdrubal Cabrera, Detroit starters Max Scherzer and Rick Porcello and Philadelphia's Cole Hamels and Hunter Pence also filed.   The White Sox were the lone team without a player who filed. Quentin was eligible, but he was traded to the Padres on New Year's Eve, and John Danks agreed to a five-year, $65-million deal that bought out his third year of arbitration eligibility.
