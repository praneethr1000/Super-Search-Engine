    "body": "SEATTLE -- As a kid growing up in New Jersey in the early 1970s, Tony Blengino immersed himself in baseball, memorizing the names and numbers of every player in the Major Leagues while rooting on his beloved Phillies. Forty years later, Blengino is a special assistant to Mariners general manager Jack Zduriencik -- serving as the team's statistical analyst and sabermetric specialist, while overseeing the club's advance-scouting staff. But he's headed back to Jersey this weekend to represent the Mariners on \"Baseball IQ,\" the MLB Network's first trivia game featuring entrants from every team in the Major Leagues. Blengino, 48, won a written in-office trivia contest among about a dozen Mariners employees, and will attempt to earn up to $45,000 in charitable contributions for Mariners Care by advancing to the top of the 32-person bracket in the game-show format. \"I remember being in the Tri-State spelling bee in about 8th grade,\" Blengino said with a chuckle. \"That's the only thing I can think of in my lifetime that is similar. But, no, that wasn't on national television.\"  Contestants will go head-to-head with each other in an NCAA tournament-type bracket, with Blengino opening against Oakland representative David Nosti, an account manager for the A's.  Teams are sending everyone -- from front-office executives to video coordinators to marketing directors -- to the competition. The Reds are sending their scoreboard operator, while the Yankees nominated their museum curator. The Padres will use an executive vice president.  Two episodes of the show will air every Tuesday through Thursday at 6 p.m. PT from Jan. 24 through Feb. 23, 31 episodes in all, leading up to the championship.  Blengino is flying back to Secaucus, N.J., on Sunday and will tape his first-round show on Monday. If he stays alive, he'll continue taping shows through Friday. The timing could be better, he acknowledges, but he'll go and give it his best shot.  \"I'm not nervous at all,\" he said. \"It's hard to say I'm excited, either. It's the offseason and you only have so many days to prepare. Obviously, we've got a lot of things to talk about on a day-to-day basis.  \"But it's something different to do and something pretty cool. The people in my family will be excited, and people I know can bust my chops about it, but it's an odd thing. Just something different. A life experience, I suppose.\"  For Blengino, it's a life experience he's been preparing for since his mom bought him a Sports Illustrated baseball board game -- similar to Strat-o-matic -- for Christmas when he was 8.  \"I remember bits and pieces of baseball before then, but at that point it became an obsession,\" Blengino said. \"Playing, watching, reading about the game. Literally, as a kid, I was going to bed with the Baseball Encyclopedia.  \"I loved to read. I loved numbers. I loved baseball. And baseball is where all that came together.\"  Blengino played the game through high school in Magnolia, N.J., then graduated with an accounting degree from St. Joseph's University in Philadelphia in 1985. He began working as a Certified Public Accountant, but always kept baseball in the back of his mind as a potential career.  He did some coaching, some writing and lots of research, getting involved with SABR (Society of American Baseball Research) and eventually authoring a book called \"Future Stars,\" a scouting and statistical review of Minor League prospects.  \"It was just finding that entry way,\" he said. \"I met [former Mariners pro scouting director] Carmen Fusco, and he suggested becoming an amateur scout. So I started applying for jobs.\"  Ultimately, Blengino caught on with the Brewers in 2002, becoming an area scout for Zduriencik on the East Coast, and eventually his assistant scouting director in Milwaukee. When Zduriencik hired on with the Mariners in 2008, he brought Blengino with him.  Now, his baseball knowledge will be put to the test in a different way, for fun and charity. As usual, Blengino analyzes his chances numerically.  \"They gave us a DVD, which I haven't had time to look at yet,\" he said. \"But I read the rules, and got a pretty good feel for the format and way the questions will be laid out from the test we took.  \"I'm not sure [the contest is] something you can really study for. It looks like they're looking for lists, like the top 15 winning pitchers in Padres history or things like that. So if I've got a spare hour between now and then and can look at lists of things, maybe it'll improve my chances by one or two percent. But who the heck knows what the subject matter will be.\"  A list of all the competitors and details on the show can be seen at http:\/\/mlb.mlb.com\/network\/promotions\/BBIQ.jsp.
