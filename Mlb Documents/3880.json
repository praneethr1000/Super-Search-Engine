    "body": "HARTFORD, Conn. -- Red Sox president\/CEO Larry Lucchino threw his complete support behind the Mitchell Report on Friday afternoon.  \"What I'd like to see is what the Commissioner would like to see and what all the teams in baseball would like to see, is a thorough ventilating of the [performance-enhancement] era, and I think Sen. [George] Mitchell's Report helps do that,\" Lucchino said. \"And a punctuation point to this because I think the Commissioner has established his commitment to putting this in our rearview mirror.\"  On hand to show off the club's 2004 and '07 World Series trophies to Connecticut-based Red Sox fans, Lucchino, who began his career as an attorney, was asked during a media session if players should face criminal prosecution and Hall of Fame banishment. \"Those questions are above my pay grade -- certainly, the one about criminal prosecution,\" Lucchino said. \"I think the first thing George Mitchell said was that he did not expect his Report would not be the basis for any punishment of the players named. And that's all I'll do, is quote George Mitchell on that.\"   \"The Hall of Fame is a question each individual voter must decide on their own,\" he added. \"There are certain standards that are specified in the Hall of Fame application process, and voters can make their own judgment.\"      Lucchino said that he believed Mitchell's approach was the right one for baseball to support.   \"I agree with Sen. Mitchell and his approach to it, and that's about as much as I should say,\" Lucchino said. Mike Petraglia is a contributor to MLB.com.
