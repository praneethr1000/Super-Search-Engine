    "body": "MIAMI -- A day after signing a benchmark multimillion dollar contract, Dontrelle Willis spent part of his Tuesday morning in a barbershop chair.  Always on the go, the suddenly richer 24-year-old Marlins ace got a haircut because he is getting ready for a big event later in the week. On Thursday night, Willis will be in Guthrie, Okla., receiving the Warren Spahn Award, presented by the Oklahoma Sports Museum to the top left-handed pitcher in the league.  Willis is being recognized for his 22-10 season in 2005, where he topped the Majors in wins and shutouts (five). He will be presented the award by Hall of Famer Fergie Jenkins. These are exciting times for Willis, who signed a one-year, $4.35 million contract on Monday.   \"I don't feel any richer,\" said Willis, who inked the largest deal ever by a big-league starting pitcher in his first year of eligibility for arbitration. \"I'm doing the same things I did last week. I don't yet see the magnitude of that [salary] number. I see the number but not the magnitude. With the money, I'm going to do something for my grandma and my mom.\"   The humble star has shown maturity beyond his years since he was called up from Double-A in May 2003, becoming an immediate success and a big reason why the club won the World Series that year.   On Jan. 12, the D-Train turned 24, and his motor never stops running.   The day his agent, Matt Sosnick, was finalizing details of his new contract, which includes the potential for $200,000 more with incentives, Willis was throwing a bullpen session in Jupiter, Fla. At the Roger Dean Stadium complex, he got his workout in by throwing to Nationals catcher Brian Schneider, who lives in the area.   Three days a week Willis is tossing bullpens as he readies for not only Spring Training, but the World Baseball Classic.   Willis is one of nine starting pitchers in the mix to represent the United States in the WBC. It just so happens that Schneider is among the catching candidates for Team USA. So the two potential teammates are getting some work in together.   And Willis is receiving updates on the roster process from USA manager Buck Martinez, who called the left-hander the other day.   Despite leading the Major Leagues in victories (22) in 2005, Willis isn't taking for granted that he even will make the team. A two-time All-Star, the D-Train is going with the flow and following the World Baseball Classic updates on television.      \"I'm just getting phone calls and I'm looking on TV and seeing myself on the roster with the other guys,\" Willis said. \"To me, there is no higher honor than to represent your country.\"   While critics of the WBC point out the risk of injury to players, Willis sees the benefits of wearing a jersey with the letters USA across the front.   \"Regardless if it is figure skating or volleyball, if you are playing for your country, there is no bigger honor,\" the left-hander said. \"When you put on that jersey, you are representing everybody from Maine to Miami.\"   A key to staying healthy, Willis says, is knowing how your body reacts. As part of his maturation process as a player, the D-Train says he now has a better understanding of getting into shape and staying that way.   Willis says he is feeling refreshed and strong. His bullpen throwing sessions have been from eight to 15 minutes long. He's in the process of building up stamina and arm strength.   There have been times that his command has been so effective down in the strike zone that he stops throwing. When things are going that smoothly, he says he's \"saving bullets.\" A difference between the Willis of today compared to a few years ago is he realizes fatigue can lead to bad habits. With his high leg kick and unconventional delivery, keeping a consistent release point is crucial.   \"I know my body, and my confidence is in my [workout] regimen,\" Willis said.   For skeptics who point out that players who are involved in the WBC can wear down late in the year, Willis presents an argument that players in various Winter Leagues enjoy success throughout the MLB season.   Marlins third baseman Miguel Cabrera, who will play for Venezuela in the WBC, plays winter ball for his hometown team in Aragua.   \"Miguel gets about 600 at-bats during the season, and about another 150 at-bats in winter ball and the Caribbean World Series,\" Willis said. \"I don't hear any moans and groans from him.\"   In fact, Willis sees Cabrera being a dominant hitter year-round.   \"That ball definitely comes off his bat the same way in August as it does in January,\" Willis said. \"We're young guys, and we're taking advantage of this opportunity.\" Joe Frisaro is a reporter for MLB.com.
