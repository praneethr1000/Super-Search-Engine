    "body": "ANAHEIM -- The Angels officially said goodbye to fan favorite Efren Navarro on Tuesday, trading him to the Orioles for cash considerations. Navarro, a left-handed-hitting first baseman who can also play the outfield corners, was designated for assignment last week in order to create room on the 40-man roster for new reliever Al Alburquerque. Baltimore then claimed Navarro off waivers, prompting the trade. â€¢ Hot Stove Tracker Navarro fought his way all the way through the Angels' system, despite being taken in the 50th and final round of the 2007 Draft, thanks largely to his elite defense, solid on-base ability and unrelenting belief. He batted .246\/.303\/.324 in 280 Major League plate appearances from 2011-15, but he was never really given consistent playing time.  Thank you for 9 years of commitment to the #Angels organization, Efren! We wish you all the best. pic.twitter.com\/fiGFfTYreO Navarro, 29, holds several team records for the Angels' Triple-A affiliate, the Salt Lake Bees, including games played (552), hits (660), runs (336), total bases (937), doubles (153), RBIs (307), extra-base hits (199), walks (216) and sacrifice flies (27). His father, best friend and mentor, Efren Sr., passed away right before he was scheduled to report to Spring Training last year, so Navarro slept at his grieving mother's home in nearby Lynwood, Calif., whenever he was in the Majors and the team was at home. Along the way, Angels coaches, players and fans grew to respect and admire Navarro for his resolve, work ethic and character. Alden Gonzalez is a reporter for MLB.com.
