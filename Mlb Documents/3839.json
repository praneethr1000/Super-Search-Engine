    "body": "BOSTON -- In what has become nearly as hot a ticket as the Red Sox at Fenway Park, the eighth annual \"Hot Stove, Cool Music\" benefit concert will once again be the focus of baseball and music fans alike on Sunday.  The event, which has raised $1.3 million for the Jimmy Fund and Theo and Paul Epstein's \"Foundation to Be Named Later\" since December 2000, is once again a virtual sellout at the Paradise Club in Boston.  \"The winter event has its own unique personality because it's cold outside, people haven't been getting out much,\" said general manager Theo Epstein on Saturday. \"It has a fun spirit, and people are just happy to be getting out of the house, [to] hear great music, raise money for charity and talk baseball. \"It's always a great, very vibrant atmosphere. Everyone has a blast. The summertime event is fun, but the baseball and music experience can't be matched at the winter program.\"   Event information for Sunday night's program can be found online at www.hotstovecoolmusic.org.   In promoting the event on Saturday at the State Street Pavilion at Fenway Park, Epstein hosted a two-part, one-of-a-kind Boston sports and celebrity panel discussion for fans hosted by the comedian\/actor Mike O'Malley.   \"I thought it was a great panel,\" Epstein said. \"As always, Red Sox fans and Boston sports fans generally have a high level of interest in the game, much different than the typical questions you get in most markets.   \"They're really cerebral fans, and that was reflected in the Q&A. We had a great panel today and hopefully kept the hot stove warm until Spring Training, about six weeks away.\"  The first half of the panel discussion centered on the incredible success of the Boston sports teams and what it takes to build a winner in Boston. Those taking part included Celtics co-owner Steve Pagliuca and Bruins legend and vice president Cam Neely.   The second half was more baseball-centric, with one of the most powerful panels ever seen in one gathering. Epstein was joined by fellow general managers Brian Cashman, of the Yankees, and J.P. Ricciardi, of the Blue Jays. Red Sox consultant and epic baseball statistician Bill James, ESPN's Peter Gammons, agent Scott Boras and NESN's Tina Cervasio also participated.   Several issues were discussed, including the Johan Santana trade rumors. As for whether the Red Sox are still interested in the Twins left-hander, Epstein said that not much has changed since the talks stalled around the Winter Meetings in December.   \"We don't have a lot new to report,\" he told reporters. \"This has been a pretty slow holiday season. We'll see how things develop.\"    Mike Petraglia is a contributor to MLB.com. This story was not subject to the approval of Major League Baseball or its clubs.",
