    "body": "Every year at this time, fans start making lists of players and pitchers to follow or to draft in their fantasy leagues. I have established a list of my Top 30 starters for the coming season. The list is based upon each pitcher's chances for wins, quality starts, ERA, WHIP and strikeouts. As in all rankings, a case can be made to include different pitchers or change the ranking order. In my estimation, many factors contribute to these rankings. For example, I factor in their team's offensive lineup, their home park, their league and division, their career history, proclivity to injury and much more. There will likely be more than 215 starting pitchers during the season. In my opinion, these are the cream of the crop -- a list of 30 starting pitchers, with their 2014 stats, and another eight who easily could have been included. 30. Jeff Samardzija, White Sox: 7-13, 2.99 ERA, 1.07 WHIP, 202 SO 29. Jacob deGrom, Mets: 9-6, 2.69 ERA, 1.14 WHIP, 144 SO 28. Alex Wood, Braves: 11-11, 2.78 ERA, 1.14 WHIP, 170 SO 27.
