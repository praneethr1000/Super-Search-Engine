    "body": "Miguel Tejada won the 2004 CENTURY 21 Home Run Derby in Houston. Bobby Abreu won the 2005 event with an unforgettable display in Detroit. They are two fantasy studs who can hit home runs in bunches, and the buzz on the Hot Stove circuit Friday was over whether they might also be interchangeable parts for their Major League clubs along that I-95 corridor between Baltimore and Philadelphia. According to a report by Ken Rosenthal on FOXSports.com, the Phillies have entered this ongoing Miggy Derby by proposing to send Abreu to Baltimore for the Orioles' shortstop -- with the intention of playing Tejada at third base.  Ken Mandel of MLB.com said the deal is far from a slam dunk, as the Phillies were thought to be looking for pitching in a deal for Abreu, and Baltimore was supposedly searching for pitching as well. It was also unclear if Tejada would embrace a position change.  The potential Tejada-Manny Ramirez trade lost steam after the latter said Thursday that he was resigned to staying with the Red Sox. Ramirez's agent said the player denied making those comments, insinuating that there were still deal possibilities. Rosenthal cited sources familiar with the negotiations who said the Orioles want pitching in addition to Abreu, \"raising the possibility of an expanded deal.\"  Let's just say it happens and Tejada does move to third base. It would be the answer to the question: \"Where have all those elite American League shortstops gone?\" Once there was a time when an All-Star voter had an annual dilemma in trying to choose among Derek Jeter (Yankees), Alex Rodriguez (Rangers), Nomar Garciaparra (Red Sox), Omar Vizquel (Indians) and Tejada (A's). It was the toughest choice on the ballot.  Could Jeter become the only AL shortstop left from that fab five? A-Rod moved to third after being traded to the Yankees. Garciaparra just joined the Dodgers, but so did Rafael Furcal, so the former is projected as the starting first baseman on the team's depth chart. Vizquel is in the National League these days, preparing for his second year at short with the Giants and his 18th straight in the Majors.   If Tejada joins that list of Philly third basemen that included Mike Schmidt, then it would leave Jeter as the only one of those stars manning the 6 spot on the field in the junior circuit.  Tigers president\/general manager Dave Dombrowski declined comment to Thursday's report in the Boston Herald that the Tigers had expressed interest in trading for Tejada. Asked in more general terms whether he'd take the risk of trading for a player in the middle of a multiyear contract when he could demand a trade a year later, Dombrowski said it depended on the player.  There had been expectations that the Miggy Derby would be wrapped up by week's end. One key name vanished off the rumor mill by Friday night: Corey Koskie. The Twins reportedly were going to wait out the process and perhaps make a run at bringing him back near the start of Spring Training -- but Toronto, with newcomer Troy Glaus set at third base -- pulled the trigger on a surprise trade that sent him to Milwaukee for Minor League righty Brian Wolfe.  Suddenly Milwaukee, which improved to .500 in 2005, is starting to look more and more like a possible breakout team in 2006. Just like the team that just dealt Koskie away. It's going to be an interesting season.  Elsewhere around the Hot Stove:  Cubs: According to a story in the Baltimore Sun, the Cubs and Orioles are talking trade -- but it's not about Tejada. The Orioles are reportedly interested in acquiring center fielder Corey Patterson from the Cubs. The Sun quotes an industry source saying the Orioles would give the Cubs a Minor Leaguer for Patterson, who batted a disappointing .215 in 2005. According to the story, the Cubs still are interested in Tejada, but those talks have stalled.  ESPN 1000 in Chicago reported Friday afternoon that at least four teams are interested in Patterson.  Nationals: Nationals infielder Jamey Carroll avoided arbitration by signing a one-year, $700,000 contract. The deal is non-guaranteed. The team now has five players -- Luis Ayala, Marlon Byrd, Nick Johnson, Brian Schneider and Alfonso Soriano -- who are still eligible for arbitration. A favorite of manager Frank Robinson, Carroll, 31, is considered the most fundamentally sound player on the Nationals. But Carroll's role could be reduced significantly this coming season because of the acquisitions of Marlon Anderson and Damian Jackson.  GM Jim Bowden said the team is not currently pursuing another backup catcher after losing out on top targets such as Todd Pratt and John Flaherty, who signed with the Braves and Red Sox, respectively, the Washington Post reported. Instead, they signed a collection of hopefuls to Minor League deals -- Mike DiFelice, Alberto Castillo, Wiki Gonzalez and Brandon Harper. Free agent Robert Fick, signed primarily as a pinch-hitter and backup first baseman, caught 28 games for San Diego in 2005.   \"We think we have a lot of candidates in-house,\" Bowden told the paper. \"If we get to Spring Training and a person doesn't separate himself, then we'll pursue a trade.\"     Phillies: The club is still looking to add one more pitcher and will likely use its outfield depth as a bargaining chip. This would appear to be either Jason Michaels or International League MVP Shane Victorino. An eighth-inning reliever would allow Ryan Madson to transition to the starting rotation.  Athletics: The club continues to monitor the progress of Frank Thomas, whose smiling face is right there on top of your list of available free agents on MLB.com's daily Hot Stove Report page. Thomas, 52 homers shy of 500 in his career, has not yet gained clearance to play baseball, but the San Francisco Chronicle reported that he is making progress in recovery from two different breaks in his left ankle. As to results of X-rays and a bone scan, the paper quoted Big Hurt's agent, Arn Tellem: \"It's all favorable. The doctors are all optimistic, and I think the A's are waiting for Frank to be cleared later in the month.\"   Mark Newman is enterprise editor for MLB.com.
