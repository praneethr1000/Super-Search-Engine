    "body": "OAKLAND -- Frank Thomas hit his 300th career home run in Oakland and he'd like to hit No. 500 there as well. If he stays healthy, the Oakland Athletics will give him every opportunity to do so.  Thomas, signed by the A's on Wednesday, was in Oakland on Thursday for his first official appearance with his new team.  \"As soon as I was released, I looked around,\" Thomas said. \"I wanted to make a serious impact quickly. The A's are an organization I have followed for a long time. When I first came up [in 1990], this was the organization. It was an easy choice.\" Rick Eymer is a contributor to MLB.com This story was not subject to the approval of Major League Baseball or its clubs.",
