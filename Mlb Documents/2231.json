    "body": "PHILADELPHIA -- The Phillies, who continue to add pitching depth to all levels of the organization this offseason, have signed reliever Jeanmar Gomez to a Minor League deal with an invitation to Major League Spring Training, the club announced on Monday. Gomez appeared in 44 games for the Pirates last season, posting a 3.19 ERA over 62 innings. The 26-year-old right-hander is expected to compete for a spot in the Phillies' bullpen in 2015. The Phils have invited 17 players to Major League camp who are not on the 40-man roster. That group includes four pitchers: Gomez, Paul Clemens, Sean O'Sullivan and Kevin Slowey.
