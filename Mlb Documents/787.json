    "body": "WASHINGTON -- The Nationals officially agreed to a one-year, $3 million contract with infielder Stephen Drew on Wednesday, the team announced. Drew could make as much as $1.25 million in incentives. Drew becomes the second member of his family to play for the Nationals franchise. Older brother Tim played for the Expos in 2002-03. â€¢ Hot Stove Tracker To make room for Drew on the 40-man roster, the Nats designated right-hander Taylor Hill for assignment. Hill, 26, appeared in nine Major League games over the past two seasons, going 0-1 with a 6.00 ERA. Hill's only big league start came on Sept. 26, 2014, vs. Miami. In 111 Minor League games spanning five seasons, Hill went 34-35 with a 3.84 ERA. He was a sixth-round pick in the 2011 Draft out of Vanderbilt University. For Drew, he will be reunited with general manager Mike Rizzo, who was with the D-backs when they selected the left-handed hitter in the first round of the 2004 Draft. Rizzo was Arizona's scouting director at the time. Drew has played most of his career at shortstop and could see time there as well as second base. Last season, Drew played with the Yankees, hitting .201 with 17 home runs and 44 RBIs while playing mostly second base. Drew spent five-plus seasons with the D-backs, and his best season was in 2008, when he hit .291 with 21 home runs, 67s RBIs, 91 runs scored and a .333 on-base percentage. Drew also has postseason experience. He has appeared in 28 playoff games, including starting at shortstop in each of Boston's 16 postseason games in 2013, while helping the Red Sox secure the World Series title. Drew also appeared in the postseason with the D-backs in 2007 and the A's in '12. Bill Ladson is a reporter for MLB.com and writes an MLBlog, All Nats All the Time.
