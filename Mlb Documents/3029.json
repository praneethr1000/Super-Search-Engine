    "body": "MILWAUKEE -- The Brewers will know before the start of Spring Training whether Ryan Braun will be their left fielder on Opening Day, according to a report.  Braun is appealing a suspension under Major League Baseball's Joint Drug Prevention and Treatment Program, and he and attorney David Cornwell will get to make a case before a panel of arbiters before the end of this month. That three-member panel would then hand down its verdict well before Brewers pitchers and catchers report to Maryvale Baseball Park in Phoenix on Feb. 18, according to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel.  The hearing is not tied to Braun's scheduled appearance at a Baseball Writers' Association of America function in New York on Jan. 21, according to the newspaper. It would be Braun's first public appearance since ESPN reported in mid-December that he faced as much as a 50-game suspension. Braun is the reigning National League MVP after batting .332 with 33 home runs, 111 RBIs and 33 stolen bases in 2011. He is even more important to the Brewers' lineup in 2012 because slugging first baseball Prince Fielder is a free agent.     Adam McCalvy is a reporter for MLB.com.
