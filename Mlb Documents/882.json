    "body": "The Red Sox and left-hander Robbie Ross Jr. avoided arbitration by settling on a one-year deal Friday. According to MLB Network's Jon Heyman, Ross will be paid $1.25 million for the 2016 season. Ross, 26, came to Boston last January in a trade that sent pitcher Anthony Ranaudo to Texas. He was eligible for arbitration for the first time this offseason after making $566,500 in 2015. Ross made 54 relief appearances for the Red Sox last season, posting a 3.86 ERA over 60 2\/3 innings, with 20 walks and 53 strikeouts. He held left-handed batters to a .224 batting average, compared to .272 for righties. Over four seasons in the Majors with the Rangers and Red Sox, Ross owns a 3.95 ERA, including a 3.45 mark in 192 relief appearances. Boston previously settled with its other two players who filed for arbitration, righties Joe Kelly and Junichi Tazawa. The club has not taken a player to an arbitration hearing since Rolando Arrojo in 2001. Andrew Simon is a reporter for MLB.com. Follow him on Twitter @AndrewSimonMLB.
