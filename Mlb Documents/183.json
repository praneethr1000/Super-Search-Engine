    "body": "Major League Baseball filed a claim on Wednesday to mediate its dispute with District of Columbia officials regarding construction of a new downtown ballpark for the Washington Nationals.  The step was necessitated because the D.C. City Council failed to meet a contractual end-of-the-year deadline to sign a lease with MLB, plus secure a site and financing for the ballpark, which was originally pegged at $535 million.  \"Now that the Dec. 31st deadline for signing a lease on the new ballpark site has passed, we believe the best way to move the process forward for the benefit of the District's baseball fans is through the mediation process,\" said Bob DuPuy, MLB's president and chief operating officer. \"It is our contractual right to seek mediation as a tool to convince the parties to fulfill their obligations as set forth in the contract that was agreed to more than a year ago.\" Barry M.
