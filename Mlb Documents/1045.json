    "body": "That the Cardinals are good is a given. That they have been quiet this winter is not a surprise.  But in an improving National League Central, are the Cards, as currently constructed, good enough?  The Cardinals, despite their Wild Card status, were obviously good enough to advance deep into the postseason each of the last two years -- surviving in no fewer than four winner-take-all October environments (Game 5 of the 2011 NL Division Series against the Phillies, Game 7 of the '11 World Series against the Rangers and the NL Wild Card round against the Braves and Game 5 of the NLDS against the Nationals last year).
