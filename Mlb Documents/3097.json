    "body": "DENVER -- The Rockies acquired Chad Tracy, a Minor League power-hitting first baseman and the son of manager Jim Tracy, from the Rangers on Thursday for right-handed pitcher Greg Reynolds.  Tracy, 26, a third-round pick of the Rangers in the 2006 First-Year Player Draft, hit .259 with 26 home runs and a system-leading 109 RBIs at Triple-A Round Rock. The RBI total was a Round Rock franchise record. Tracy received an invitation to Major League Spring Training.  The Rockies also announced Thursday that third baseman Casey Blake, 38, passed his physical, so his one-year contract worth $2 million, with an additional $1 million available in incentives, is official.
