    "body": "MILWAUKEE -- The Brewers' surprising late-season surge apparently propelled the team into ticket-selling season.  The club announced Wednesday it had sold its 1 millionth ticket for 2013, reaching that milestone on the second-earliest date in franchise history. The record was set last winter, when the Brewers were coming off an appearance in the National League Championship Series and sold 1 million tickets by Dec. 22, 2011.  \"Fans are clearly excited for the upcoming season as evidenced by the strong ticket sales to date,\" Brewers chief operating officer Rick Schlesinger said in a statement. \"We look forward to an exciting year at Miller Park and appreciate the support of the fans, who once again are demonstrating their unrivaled support and passion for the team.\" The Brewers open the 2013 season at home against the Rockies on April 1.
