    "body": "KANSAS CITY -- Royals general manager Dayton Moore, as is his policy, is not confirming a report that the Royals have opened renegotiation talks with the representatives for catcher Salvador Perez. MLB Network's Jon Heyman tweeted on Monday that the Royals were trying to rework\/extend Perez's present contract, which originally was a five-year deal signed in 2012 with club options from 2017-19. â€¢ Hot Stove Tracker \"As I've said before,\" Moore said by phone, \"it doesn't do our organization any good to discuss any negotiation publicly.\" While the contract -- which has a maximum value of $26.5 million -- has been criticized lately as overly club-friendly, it was actually a risky venture for the Royals when Perez signed it. He had played in just 39 games before signing it and then scared club officials when he tore a ligament in his knee two weeks later, missing months of playing time -- a reminder of how potentially risky the long-term deal was. Perez, the World Series Most Valuable Player, is set to earn at least $2 million in 2016. Through performance escalators, the 25-year-old's salary under the current deal would increase to $3.825 million in '17, $5.15 million in '18 and $6.3 million in '19. Perez, who has averaged 143 games over the past three seasons, is expected to appear at the Royals' FanFest this weekend. Jeffrey Flanagan is a reporter for MLB.com.
