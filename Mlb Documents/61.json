    "body": "BRADENTON, Fla. -- The Pittsburgh Pirates' offseason overhaul has resulted in more than a few unfamiliar faces strolling through the Pirate City clubhouse at the team's minicamp this year.  Among the most prominent of the many newcomers are veteran reliever Roberto Hernandez and starter Victor Santos, a pair of pitchers who could play pivotal roles in the team's fortunes in 2006.  Hernandez, a 41-year-old right-hander who ranks 10th all time in the big leagues with 324 career saves, was signed to a one-year, $2.75 million free agent deal in December. The team is counting on Hernandez to replace the departed Jose Mesa as the leader of the bullpen while also providing insurance in the event that Mike Gonzalez struggles in his first season as a closer.
