    "body": "The start of Spring Training is just around the corner for the Mariners. Pitchers and catchers report on Feb. 13 and have their first workout on Feb. 14. The first full-squad workout at Peoria Sports Complex will be Feb. 18. Leading up to camp, MLB.com will take a closer look at the 2009 team, position-by-position. Today: corner infielders.   When left-handed batter Russell Branyan steps into the batter's box, one of three things usually happens. He walks, strikes out or hits a home run.  That explains his nickname, \"3TO\" -- three true outcomes. Third-base coach Bruce Hines will be working with the Mariners infielders and expects Branyan to have a smooth move across the diamond.               Jim Street is a reporter for MLB.com.
