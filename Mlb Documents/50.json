    "body": "OAKLAND -- The A's continue to chip away at their list of arbitration-eligible players, Wednesday agreeing to 2006 contracts with recently acquired outfielder Milton Bradley and righty setup man Kiko Calero.  Picked up last month in a trade with the Dodgers, Bradley, 27, will make a reported $3 million, and his deal includes incentives that could bring an additional $200,000. He made $2.5 million with Los Angeles in 2005, when he batted .290 with 13 home runs and 38 RBIs while being limited by injuries to 75 games.  Calero, who turned 31 on Monday, gets an even bigger raise, from $330,000 in 2005 to $850,000 in 2006. Acquired in December 2004 from the Cardinals in the trade than sent Mark Mulder to St. Louis, Calero made 58 relief appearances with the A's last year and was 4-1 with a save and a 3.23 ERA. He allowed a .216 opponents' batting average. The A's, who on Monday signed outfielder Bobby Kielty to a one-year $1.85 million deal, now have three arbitration-eligible players unsigned: righty Juan Cruz, catcher Adam Melhuse and second baseman Mark Ellis.   \"Two more done, three more to go,\" assistant general manager David Forst told the Associated Press. \"We're making good progress.\"   Forst last week said he doesn't expect the club to go to arbitration with any of its players, and that there have been no multiyear talks with any of the unsigned.
