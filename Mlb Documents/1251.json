    "body": "First basemen Garrett Jones and Gaby Sanchez agreed to one-year contracts on Friday with the Pirates, who exchanged salary figures with two other players eligible for arbitration.  The Pirates and second baseman Neil Walker and right-handed starter James McDonald did the requisite exchanges at the deadline for submitting requests and offers for the process.  Walker proposed a $3.6 million salary for 2013, while the club proposed $3 million. Walker, who earned $500,000 in 2012, is eligible for his first crack at arbitration as a Super Two qualifier. Jones, who was the only Bucs player to go through a hearing a year ago, signed for $4.5 million, according to a report by The Associated Press. Last February, the arbitration panel ruled in favor of the club in awarding Jones a salary of $2.25 million, which had been very close to his request for $2.5 million.
