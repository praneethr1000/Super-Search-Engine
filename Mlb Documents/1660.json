    "body": "NEW YORK -- Yankees right-hander Michael Pineda is set to reach a major checkpoint in his recovery from right shoulder surgery, graduating to tossing from a half mound on Tuesday at the club's complex in Tampa, Fla. The 24-year-old Pineda missed all of the 2012 season due to injury after being acquired from the Mariners in January. Yankees general manager Brian Cashman said that the organization is hopeful that the right-hander will be an option at the big league level by June or July. Pineda underwent arthroscopic surgery in May to repair an anterior labral tear of his pitching shoulder after experiencing weakness, and later pain, during his Spring Training appearances. The Yanks said that they believe Pineda was healthy at the time of the trade; he underwent a full physical, including an MRI exam, before the deal, and no issues were found. Pineda has yet to make his regular-season debut wearing pinstripes. Pineda made a splash in 2011 with the Mariners and was named as an American League All-Star, going 9-10 with a 3.74 ERA in 28 starts before being acquired by New York with pitcher Jose Campos for power-hitting catcher Jesus Montero and pitcher Hector Noesi. ‪Bryan Hoch is a reporter for MLB.com.
