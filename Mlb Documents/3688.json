    "body": "SAN FRANCISCO -- Demonstrating their belief that Pablo Sandoval's 2011 resurgence was legitimate, the Giants agreed to terms with the third baseman on a three-year contract extension Tuesday, avoiding salary arbitration. Sandoval, 25, hit .315 with 23 home runs and 70 RBIs in 117 games last year and made the National League All-Star team. He accomplished this despite missing 40 early-season games after sustaining a broken right hamate bone and recovering from the subsequent surgery. Sandoval's success contrasted with his struggles in 2010, when he batted .268 with 13 homers and 63 RBIs. More was expected from the switch-hitter after a rousing 2009 (.330, 25 homers, 90 RBIs), but he was noticeably overweight as he slumped. A determined Sandoval lost approximately 40 pounds before last season, which improved his range defensively and boosted his confidence. Chris Haft is a reporter for MLB.com.
