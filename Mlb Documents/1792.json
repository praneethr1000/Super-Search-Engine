    "body": "BALTIMORE -- Orioles executive vice president of baseball operations Dan Duquette addressed season-ticket holders this morning at the club's annual FanFest convention, and he acknowledged there had been some substance to the Toronto rumors, though his \"sole and singular focus\" is on improving the Orioles. \"I thought it was important for Orioles fans to know that,\" said Duquette, who was coveted by Toronto for its CEO position. The Blue Jays recently announced that Paul Beeston will continue as their CEO. \"Like I said, my focus is on the O's and helping them, and I'm glad to be doing that,\" said Duquette Asked whether he thought the Toronto rumors were behind him for good, Duquette just reiterated his interest in improving Baltimore for the upcoming season. As for the rumors being a potential distraction in the O's front office, Duquette said the Orioles have continued to do what they do every winter: try to improve the team in a day-by-day and piece-by-piece manner.
