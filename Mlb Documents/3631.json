    "body": "ARLINGTON -- Rangers co-owner Ray Davis was spotted walking through the hotel lobby on the last day of the Winter Meetings in Dallas. He stopped to engage in polite conversation, and was told there was really nothing going on at the moment.  \"Oh yes there is,\" Davis said with a smile. He declined to elaborate.  Turns out that Davis and other members of the ownership group had just left a meeting with Rangers general manager Jon Daniels, president Nolan Ryan and others. The Rangers owners had just heard a presentation on why Texas should pursue Japanese pitcher Yu Darvish, who will be introduced at a press conference at the Ballpark in Arlington on Friday night at 7 p.m. CT, to be aired live by MLB.com and texasrangers.com. The length of the deal was crucial. Darvish's agents wanted a five-year deal, while the Rangers, because of the size of the investment, wanted six years. The final agreement was for six years, but also allows Darvish to opt out after five years if he meets certain high-end performance levels mainly based on Cy Young Award voting.      T.R.
