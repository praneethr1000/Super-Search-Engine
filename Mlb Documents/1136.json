    "body": "DENVER -- The Rockies will be among the teams that will scout former Cy Young Award winner Brandon Webb's throwing session, which will occur sometime in the next couple of weeks, Rockies senior vice president of Major League operations Bill Geivett said. The Rockies' interest in the workout session, which was first reported Friday by the Denver Post, is part of the club's attempt to find an accomplished pitcher with a history of forcing ground balls -- a profile the club wants to stick to in any trade or free-agency endeavor. Webb would be considered a low-risk maneuver. Webb, 33, won the National League Cy Young Award in 2006 and finished second in NL voting the following two years while with the D-backs before having his career short-circuited by shoulder problems. The right-hander last pitched in the Majors in 2009 with the D-backs. His last action was four games in the Minors with the Rangers in 2011. The Rockies have signed left-handed pitcher Erick Threets, who has pitched in the Majors with the Giants and the White Sox, to a Minor League contract with an invitation to Major League Spring Training, Rockies player development director Jeff Bridich said.
