    "body": "The Mets avoided arbitration with right-hander Bobby Parnell on Thursday, agreeing to a one-year contract for 2013. The deal is reportedly worth $1.7 million. Parnell, 28, appeared in a career-high 74 games with the Mets last season. He was one of the club's stronger relievers, earning a 5-4 record with seven saves and a 2.49 ERA. Taken in the ninth round of the 2005 First-Year Player Draft, the North Carolina native has compiled a 13-19 record with 14 saves and a 3.83 ERA in five seasons with the Mets. This deal marks the end to Parnell's first year of arbitration. The Mets still have cases pending for first baseman Ike Davis and second baseman Daniel Murphy. Gary Cotton is a reporter for MLB.com.
