    "body": "KANSAS CITY -- In the beginning, the Negro Leagues Baseball Museum was lucky to get one or maybe two award recipients to collect its hardware in person.  Now, with the sixth annual Legacy Awards banquet coming up on Saturday night, it's the thing to do for Major League honorees.  Dontrelle Willis of the Florida Marlins, Derrek Lee of the Chicago Cubs and Michael Young of the Texas Rangers are among the award winners scheduled to be at the Gem Theater in Kansas City. For ticket availability, call (816) 221-1920. Others expected include Chone Figgins of the Los Angeles Angels, Bob Wickman of the Cleveland Indians, Chad Cordero of the Washington Nationals and general manager Ken Williams of the world champion Chicago White Sox.   Albert Pujols of the St. Louis Cardinals, who could not attend, visited the museum on Tuesday to receive the Oscar Charleston Award as National League Most Valuable Player.   Royals president Dan Glass and Hall of Famer Dave Winfield will receive the Buck O'Neil Award for support of the museum. Because Glass is in Australia on a goodwill trip, assistant general manager Muzzy Jackson will accept the award for him.   Former player and longtime Major League executive Bob Watson will receive the Jackie Robinson Award for lifetime achievement.   Also expected to join museum chairman O'Neil and lend their support are Brian Jordan, Ferguson Jenkins, Willie Horton, Willie Wilson, Dave Stewart, Joe Carter, David Segui and Rick Sutcliffe.   Why not?
