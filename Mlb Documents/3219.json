    "body": "ST. LOUIS -- While the Cardinals have not yet named a starting second baseman, general manager John Mozeliak certainly hinted that the job is Tyler Greene's to lose. Daniel Descalso remains in the mix, too, though Descalso could fit well as a utility infielder off the bench if Greene does end up seizing the starting job.  \"We do want to see Tyler Greene get a strong opportunity [at second base],\" Mozeliak said. \"We look at his athleticism and what he's capable of doing [and] seeing that for a large volume or 150 games would be interesting to us.\"  Though Greene has never thrived at the big league level, he's also never had much consistent playing time to prove himself. Injuries gave Greene the opportunity to make a string of starts for St. Louis last May, but he did little to make a statement. Such has been the case during Greene's various stints with the Cardinals the last three years. Still, the Cardinals remain high on Greene's skill set and perhaps giving Greene a longer leash on a starting role will allow him the opportunity to get comfortable and finally produce as he has in the Minor Leagues.   \"I'm looking forward to this year,\" said Greene, who hit .212 with a .322 on-base percentage in 58 games with St. Louis last year. \"I've learned a lot over the last couple years. [I'm] just really looking forward to coming to Spring Training ready, and using what I've learned the last couple years to my advantage.\"",
