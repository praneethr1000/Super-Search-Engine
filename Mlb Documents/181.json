    "body": "What is it about voters for the Hall of Fame not giving credit -- and checkmarks -- where it's due? Unable to recognize merit, appreciate tenacity, reward achievement?  Nonsense.  Just look at the 2005 vote. Some right-hander named John Bert Morris was named on 97.73 percent of the ballots, nearly matching the support for Nolan Ryan, the last starting pitcher elected to the Hall back in 1999 with a 98.79 score. TJ  288 wins, No. 24 all-time. All 23 ahead of him are in the Hall of Fame, except for Bobby Mathews, who retired in '87 -- 1887 -- and Roger Clemens and Greg Maddux, who presumably will be.  700 starts. Only Hall of Famers Cy Young, Ryan, Don Sutton, Phil Niekro and Steve Carlton have more.  Three 20-win seasons; Ryan had two.            Tom Singer is a reporter for MLB.com.
