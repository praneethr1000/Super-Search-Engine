    "body": "He knew there would be cynical suggestions and snide asides. This, after all, is Ed Wade's third tour of duty in Philadelphia. He understands the territory. In four years as general manager of the Astros, Wade made dozens of deals. Three of the most significant, however, sent fan favorites to the Phillies, the team he had served in the same capacity for nearly a decade:  Brad Lidge, at his first General Managers Meetings with Houston. Lidge then went 47-for-47 in save opportunities, including the postseason, and the Phils went on to win the World Series.  Roy Oswalt, at the Trade Deadline in 2010. Oswalt dominated down the stretch, helping the Phillies win their fourth straight division title.   Hunter Pence, exactly a year later. His arrival sparked the offense and helped the Phils make the playoffs again with a franchise-record 102 wins.  Each of these moves paid immediate dividends at Citizens Bank Park. At Minute Maid Park, not so much. After the Astros lost 106 games last season, new ownership decided to hire its own general manager. A couple months later, Wade was back with the Phillies as a special consultant with responsibility for Major League and Minor League scouting, plus helping with salary arbitration.  So Wade joked at the time that he was prepared for the inevitable conclusions that would be drawn. That he had favored the Phils in trades because of his close relationships with club president Dave Montgomery and general manager Ruben Amaro Jr. That he made these moves mindful of the possibility he might someday want to return to the organization he first joined as a public relations intern in 1977.  \"But I went back. And the reality is that in those four years I was general manager down there, we made deals with 16 clubs,\" Wade pointed out. \"It wasn't Philadelphia exclusive. In fact, I teased Ruben a little bit. I said I was halfway tempted, when people asked me how familiar I was with the Phillies' system, to say that I was familiar enough to know that the best prospects were Astros now.\"  Funny. Still, this is what tends to get overlooked. That, and the fact that Wade had been directed to lower the big league payroll and rebuild the farm system. From that point of view, he had a pretty successful run.  In return for Pence, Wade got right-hander Jarred Cosart, slugging first baseman Jonathan Singleton and outfielder Domingo Santana. They are currently ranked first, second and 10th, respectively, by MLB.com among Astros prospects.  For Oswalt, the return was left-hander J.A. Happ, outfielder Anthony Gose and shortstop Jonathan Villar, now listed as the Astros' third-best prospect. And Gose, subsequently traded to Toronto, is rated the Blue Jays' second best up-and-comer.  And Michael Bourn was part of the three-player package that went back to Houston for Lidge. Bourn was moved to the Braves last season for four players, including right-hander Paul Clemens (their fifth-ranked prospect) and left-hander Brett Oberholzer (eighth).  \"Everybody wants to look at it from their own perspective. But it goes without saying that the work that we did in Houston was done to try to make that organization as good as it could possibly be,\" Wade said. \"From the very beginning down there, we were traveling parallel paths -- trying to be as competitive as possible as we could be at the big league level, but certainly the task that carried the greatest magnitude was trying to rebuild the farm system.  \"So over the course of four years down there with that as the primary goal, and recognizing the financial position that we were in, prospect-driven deals were the best way to try to get the organization where it needed to be.\"  Coming back to Philadelphia after the Astros decided to make a change seems like a natural fit -- almost inevitable. Wade never gave up his home in South Jersey. It was he who had convinced Amaro to join the front office at the end of his playing career. Still, Wade hesitated, remembering the criticism he had absorbed in his final years.  \"I have to be honest. There was a little bit of a sense of unease when Ruben first contacted me, because I wanted to see it through to the end when I was dismissed at the end of 2005,\" he said. \"And obviously there were enough issues at the time that I left, that I really needed to get comfortable and to make sure my family was comfortable with coming back into that environment.  \"So I pushed Ruben off when we first talked about it. I said, 'Let's park it in neutral for a while.' But the more we talked over a number of days, the greater the sensibility of coming back was.\"  Wade also wonders what might have been. In three of his last five seasons, the Phillies finished second. On the final day of the 2005 season, the Phils beat the Nationals in Washington, but still needed the Cubs to win at Houston to tie for the Wild Card. With the tying run at second base and two outs, Chicago second baseman Jose Macias lined out to Craig Biggio.  Montgomery later conceded that had Philadelphia made the playoffs, he probably wouldn't have made the change.  \"I've wondered about that a whole lot of times,\" Wade said. \"I teased Biggio frequently about that when we were together in Houston. When you get as close as we did, there's always an inclination to say, 'What if?'\"  When the Phillies finally won it all in 2008, general manager Pat Gillick gracefully noted the contributions Wade had made in laying the foundation for that success.  You have to think that, someday, new Astros GM Jeff Luhnow could be in a position to say the same thing. Paul Hagen is a reporter for MLB.com.
