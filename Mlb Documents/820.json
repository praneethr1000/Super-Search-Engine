    "body": "With a number of big-name position players still available on the free-agent market, January figures to be a busy month on the Hot Stove. Here's a look at some of the latest news from Major Leagues Baseball's rumor mill: Logjam at the top As 2016 began, the list of unsigned free agents still included stars Yoenis Cespedes, Chris Davis, Alex Gordon and Justin Upton. â€¢ Hot Stove Tracker So what's the reason for the slow market in regards to top position players? \"Not sure, other than the prices of these hitters and that clubs are looking at the history of recent mega deals,\" Orioles executive vice president of baseball operations Dan Duquette told The Boston Globe. Aside from Jason Heyward's $184 million contract with the Cubs, most of the lucrative free-agent deals have gone toward pitching this offseason. But that hasn't stopped the top available position players from looking for their own big paydays. Davis reportedly turned down a six-year, $150 million offer to return to the O's, while Cespedes is said to be seeking a six-year contract or at least a deal worth more than $100 million. Something will have to give, and the O's, Giants, Tigers, White Sox and Angels are among the teams with holes to fill offensively. Complex contract for Maeda Details continue to trickle in regarding the Dodgers' reported signing of Japanese right-hander Kenta Maeda. Maeda's agreement with the Dodgers includes a $25 million guarantee and undisclosed performance bonuses over the eight-year deal, according to the New York Post. Maeda was posted by the Hiroshima Carp, who will receive a posting fee from the Dodgers that could reach a maximum of $20 million. Miller, Melancon could stay put Yankees left-hander Andrew Miller and Pirates closer Mark Melancon have been rumored to be available on the trade market all winter, but it appears that both relievers will remain with their current clubs, according to the Boston Globe. This falls in line with comments from Yankees general manager Brian Cashman, who said he intends to hold on to Miller despite trading for Reds closer Aroldis Chapman last week. The Astros inquired about Miller, but the Yankees were told that pitching target Lance McCullers was not available, per the Globe. The Blue Jays are also said to have checked on Miller.
