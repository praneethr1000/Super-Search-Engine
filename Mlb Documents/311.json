Each Monday, we bring you the best of the best right here in the MLB.com Mailbag. White Sox:  What is going on with Sammy Sosa? Do you think this once-great player could be headed back to Chicago for a curtain call with the Sox? -- Mike, Munster, Ind. Mike, what I have seen and heard about Sosa is that there reportedly is some mutual interest between the slugger, who is approaching 600 home runs, and the Washington Nationals. It is amazing to think that offensive forces such as Frank Thomas, Sosa and Mike Piazza all are without jobs halfway through January, a topic written about recently by MLB.com's esteemed columnist Mike Bauman. As for Sosa making a curtain call with the White Sox, the following things are more likely to happen than Sosa returning to the South Side:    The 'Dukes of Hazzard' and 'Deuce Bigalow: European Gigolo' will receive Academy Award nominations for Best Picture.    A special amendment to the Constitution, allowing George W. Bush to serve a third time as President, will be pushed through by the Democrats.    I will sign a 10-day contract with the Chicago Bulls and soon make people forget six-time champion Michael Jordan.   There's nothing close to a fit with the White Sox, skill-wise or in the clubhouse, where Sosa is concerned. In reality, I'm guessing many true White Sox fans wouldn't want Sosa to return. I actually was surprised to even receive this question. -- Scott Merkin   Diamondbacks: Do the Diamondbacks have any interest in signing Mike Piazza? -- Ron R., Lockport, N.Y.  Ron, I don't see a fit there. The Diamondbacks have Johnny Estrada as their starting catcher with Chris Snyder and Koyie Hill as backups not to mention Miguel Montero on the way. And the D-Backs don't have a need for a first baseman so I think Piazza will wind up somewhere else. -- Steve Gilbert  Astros:  The situation between the Astros and Jeff Bagwell appears to be deteriorating much like his shoulder. I understand Bagwell's contract is guaranteed and maxes out this year, but when is he going to face the facts? At best, he will be a defensive liability at first base and his effectiveness at the plate is still unknown. It's selfish for the Astros to suggest retirement in the final year of a contract, but is it even worse to handicap a team that is trying to make it back to the World Series? Bagwell has represented the city and organization with class and dignity his entire career. Would it not be best to be remembered that way and step away from the game? -- Chris B., Houston  I hope for everyone's sake that this situation doesn't get ugly, and more importantly, that it doesn't become a distraction once Spring Training starts. The way things stand now, Bagwell is planning to play this year, and he's working hard to prove to himself and the club that he can make the necessary throws from his spot at first base.   He also has to get to the point where the throwing won't affect his hitting. Hitting-wise he's fine. But last year, the throwing basically caused his shoulder to shut down. And that began to hurt his ability to hit. There are no guarantees the same thing won't happen this year.   Judging from the e-mails I've received this offseason, it appears I'm one of the very few people who thinks Jeff is going to make a comeback. But either way, doesn't he have the right to at least give it a try?   Regarding this retirement saga ... let's get a couple of things straight. The Astros did not ask Bagwell to retire, and the Houston Chronicle report didn't suggest they asked him to retire. The Chronicle report suggested the Astros want Bagwell to deem himself unable to play so that they can explore collecting on the insurance policy. There is a difference. A big difference.   That story was picked up by a wire report, which had two headlines. The first said, \"Astros ready for Bagwell to retire.\" The headline inside the story said, \"Astros ask Bagwell to retire.\" And here we have a terrific example of blatantly irresponsible journalism. I can live with the first wire headline. The second one is flat wrong.   By baseball definition, retiring means walking away from the remainder of a contract without being paid. No one is suggesting Bagwell do that. It's clear he is going to be paid the remainder of his contract, whether he plays or not. Bagwell's agent said as much -- that the two sides have not talked retirement, or a buyout, or anything of the sort. The Astros have to file a claim by Jan. 31 to have a chance to collect on the insurance, and they simply want an idea of whether or not they have a realistic chance to do so.   The Astros have every right to explore their options, and Bagwell has every right to try to make a comeback in the final year of his contract. It's an uncomfortable situation regardless of which side you're taking.   Again, let's review: Bagwell will be paid all of his money, even if he can't play. It's just a question of who pays him, the Astros or the insurance company. -- Alyson Footer  Devil Rays: Why is there so much talk about the Rays trading Julio Lugo? I know they're trying to get more pitching, but why trade one of their best players? I'm assuming Lugo has at least another seven years in him, so in due time, couldn't they move him to second and have B.J. Upton play shortstop when he's ready? -- Anonymous  You'll get no argument from me. There's no telling how much longer Lugo can be a productive shortstop, particularly given his outstanding 2005 season. And I don't think the Rays will be disappointed if they start the 2006 season with Lugo as their shortstop; I think they are considering trade offers because they want to improve the team any way they can.   Unfortunately for the new management team, they are saddled with some of the baggage from the past, and every Rays fan is sick of hearing about the future. I can see the Rays keeping Lugo at shortstop this season, but I can't see him moving to second base. Jorge Cantu is entrenched at that position, and Lugo does not want to play second. -- Bill Chastain   Cubs: Isn't the Cubs' starting rotation a big question mark? With Kerry Wood uncertain and Mark Prior having past injuries and limited injuries, common sense would suggest that the focus is in obtaining another starting pitcher by trade or free agency. Your thoughts? -- Michael K., Niles, Ill.   The Cubs don't need another arm -- they need the arms they have to stay healthy. Pitching coach Larry Rothschild and the training staff addressed the players' offseason workout programs before sending guys home after last season. Carlos Zambrano, Prior, Glendon Rusch and Jerome Williams all showed up at the Cubs Convention looking like they were ready to take the mound now.   Rothschild reports that Greg Maddux is working harder this offseason than he has in years past. It's impossible to protect the players from something like a line drive off the elbow, which Prior suffered, unless he starts wearing padding everywhere.   Wood is expected to start throwing off a mound when the team reports to Arizona in mid-February, and if he continues to progress, he could be in the rotation sometime in early 2006. That would be like getting a new pitcher. There are also youngsters like Rich Hill and Angel Guzman who need a little more time, but also could contribute this season. -- Carrie Muskat   Braves:  Why are we so concerned about a leadoff hitter when he is only the first batter of the first inning? Do you believe in the statement of a \"true leadoff hitter\"? -- No name listed, Statesville, N.C.   When you think of a leadoff hitter, you think of somebody who has good speed and the ability to get on base with great consistency. But let's not forget that there may never be another Rickey Henderson, and there are less conventional leadoff hitters who have had success in that role.   Some will say you may lead off an inning just once in the game. While that may be true, a leadoff hitter in the NL is very important because he might be able to spark a two-out rally after an opposing pitcher opens an inning by retiring the No. 8 hitter and pitcher.   A leadoff hitter is a table-setter for the big bats in the lineup. His ability to get on base with consistency gives them a chance to both come to the plate more often and have more RBI opportunities.   So, yes, I think it's vital to have a productive leadoff hitter. That's not to say that somebody like Marcus Giles, who may not be viewed as a traditional leadoff hitter, can't be successful in the role. In fact, Giles' baseball skills and savvy give him the ability to be every bit as successful in the role as Rafael Furcal was the last few years. -- Mark Bowman   A's: Based on your book about The Big Three, I'm guessing you're fairly close with Barry Zito. Have you talked to him much this offseason? Have all the rumors been bugging him? Where's his head right now? Assuming he's back, what kind of year do you expect from him? -- Gary S. (Palo Alto, Calif.)   Good timing for this question; I was in Southern California and caught up with Zito last weekend. Where's his head? Well, as far as trade rumors are concerned, I'd say they were in his dome a little early in the offseason. He has a pretty good understanding of the business side of baseball and how the media handles it, but nobody likes uncertainty. Now, though, he's all but certain he'll be with the A's this year, so I think he sees any new rumor as a source of entertainment.   I expect a very good year from Zito, who has an increased air of seriousness about him these days. I get the sense that he's tired of being a guy who's as known for his off-the-field interests as he is for his pitching. And, of course, there's always this as motivation: He's probably not going to be signed to an extension before the season starts, and impending free agency tends to bring out the best in a lot of guys. -- Mychael Urban   Phillies:  Obviously, the Phillies have been attempting to trade Bobby Abreu. If they are unable to, which looks probable, will Abreu's performance suffer because he's upset with the Phillies, who don't appear to want him? -- Tommy S., Allentown, Pa.     Yankees:  Why do the people who determine who gets into the Hall of Fame claim that Don Mattingly's career was not long enough but vote in someone like Sandy Koufax? For the first five years of his career, Koufax was mediocre, and his career was shorter than Mattingly's (11 years to Don's 14). What gives? And how can someone like Bill Mazeroski be in the Hall, a one-dimensional (defense) player who had one moment in the sun, the 1960 World Series? -- Ray K., Las Vegas  First, I must agree with you on Mazeroski. Yes, he was a tremendous defensive player, but I don't think that, along with his historic home run in the '60 Fall Classic, should be enough to get him into the Hall.   As for the Koufax argument, I'm not buying it. Koufax's six-year run from 1961-66 was as good as any stretch by any pitcher in baseball history, something that can't be said for Mattingly's amazing run from 1984-89.   During Koufax's six years, he led the league in wins three times, captured three Cy Youngs, a National League MVP Award, three pitching Triple Crowns, two World Series MVP Awards, five consecutive ERA titles, four strikeout titles and six straight All-Star selections.   Though Mattingly did make it to six consecutive All-Star Games and took home an American League MVP Award, he didn't match Koufax's accomplishments. He won one batting title, led the league in hits twice and RBIs once, but he never got the Yankees to the playoffs, let alone lead them to two titles. Once again, Mattingly falls short of another Hall comparison. -- Mark Feinsand  Indians:  What are the odds of reality TV on the Tribe's new network? Maybe \"I Want to Be a Big League GM with Mark Shapiro,\" or \" Win a Date With Grady Sizemore?\" Any thoughts? -- Pat D.  Oh my, the sky's the limit. Maybe we can throw the entire team in a big house for a \"Real World\" ripoff. Just imagine the drama that would ensue if Eric Wedge and Bob Wickman ever fought over the moustache trimmer.   In all seriousness, though, I'd like to take this opportunity to write a mass response to the dozens upon dozens of readers who have been e-mailing me with questions about the new network and whether it will be available in their respective areas.   The quick answer is that the team is currently in talks with cable and satellite providers outside of Time Warner (which is already inked to carry the network long-term) and is trying to ensure that anyone who had access to Indians games on FSN Ohio will have access to this new station. We'll know more as we get closer to Opening Day, and any further developments in this saga will be posted right here on Indians.com. -- Anthony Castrovince",
