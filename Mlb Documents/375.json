    "body": "The Boston Herald is reporting that the Red Sox and Indians have agreed in principle on a multi-player deal that would send outfielder Coco Crisp to Boston. The Red Sox would send reliever Guillermo Mota and prospect Andy Marte to the Indians in exchange for Crisp. Baseball sources told the Boston Herald that the teams agreed to a deal a few days ago provided that Cleveland could acquire another outfielder to replace Crisp. The Boston Herald reports that this replacement would possibly be Jason Michaels from the Philadelphia Phillies.  The Boston Herald reports that there was some indication that the Phillies and Indians had hoped to finalize a deal for Michaels by Saturday evening. The sources said that they believed Cleveland would send one of two relievers -- left-hander Arthur Rhodes or right-hander Rafael Betancourt -- to Philadelphia to get Michaels. In addition to Crisp, the Boston Herald is also reporting that the Sox are on the verge of signing free agent Alex Gonzalez. The 28-year-old former Florida Marlin is expected to play shortstop and bat in the nine hole for Boston.",
