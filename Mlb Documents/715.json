    "body": "WASHINGTON -- Nationals general manager Mike Rizzo added to his front-office staff Friday afternoon, hiring Dan Jennings as a special assistant to the GM. Jennings was named the Marlins' general manager at the end of the 2013 season, then took over as manager of the club on May 17 last season, even though he had no coaching or managerial experience on the professional level, after Miami dismissed Mike Redmond. After the season, Jennings was relieved of his duties after guiding the Marlins to a 55-69 record during his tenure. Jennings will provide scouting expertise for the Nationals. In his 27 years in baseball, he has experience as an area scouting cross checker and scouting director. Bill Ladson is a reporter for MLB.com and writes an MLBlog, All Nats All the Time.
