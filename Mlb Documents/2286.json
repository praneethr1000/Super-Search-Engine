    "body": "DETROIT -- While the Tigers embark on their Winter Caravan trek through Michigan later this month, manager Brad Ausmus and catcher Alex Avila will be making a side trip to Toledo, Ohio, for charity. They'll take part in the Mud Hens' second annual Tiger Talk: A Helping Hens Charity Event, scheduled for Thursday, Jan. 22 at Fifth Third Field. The event at the ballpark's Birdcage restaurant begins with a sit-down dinner at 6 p.m. ET, followed by a question-and-answer session with Ausmus and Avila. Mud Hens and Tigers items will be raffled off throughout the evening, and a live auction will include several other items up for bid. Proceeds benefit the Helping Hens Charitable Fund, which aims to work with groups and organizations to promote education and recreational development in the greater Toledo area. The fund donated $50,000 to Toledo area non-profit organizations in 2014. Tickets cost $50 for adults and $40 for children and are available at mudhens.com. Jason Beck is a reporter for MLB.com.
