    "body": "CHICAGO â€“ Aside from a potential Cactus League matchup, the White Sox won't face A.J. Pierzynski and his new Rangers team until April 30 in Texas. Count John Danks as one former Pierzynski teammate who isn't sure what to expect when facing the catcher. \"That will be different. We'll see how that goes,\" said Danks with a smile. \"You never like throwing to a guy that caught you for six years. He's not going to see anything I'm throwing up there that will be new.\" Pierzynski has never faced Danks. But he has gone 4-for-15 lifetime against Jake Peavy, 3-for-3 against Matt Lindstrom, 2-for-13 against Jesse Crain and 0-for-1 against Matt Thornton. ",
