    "subtitle": "Trend of commitments to young talents could continue with Posey, Trout and the like",
    "body": "Lifetime commitments have made a profitable business for many photographers, florists and wedding planners of the workaday world. But they're still pretty rare in a sporting world in which fame can be fleeting and stability is not assured. Still, that hasn't prevented certain Major League clubs from locking in their franchise faces for the bulk -- if not the entirety -- of their remaining playing days. You saw it years ago when the Rockies signed up for 11 years of Todd Helton and the Yankees went 10 deep with Derek Jeter. The Rox did it again when they committed to Troy Tulowitzki for a decade, and the Brewers followed with a similar deal with Ryan Braun. Anthony Castrovince is a reporter for MLB.com.
