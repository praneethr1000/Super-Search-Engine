    "body": "HOUSTON -- He was a fixture in the Astros clubhouse for more than three decades. His bushy moustache, thick northeastern accent and cynical humor were -- for those in the know -- as much a part of the organization as the Killer B's.  Dennis Liborio, the Astros' longtime clubhouse manager, has retired after 32 seasons in Houston due to health issues, the team announced Tuesday. The team said in a statement that Liborio will focus on his health while spending more time with his wife, Geraldine.  \"We sincerely thank Dennis for his dedication and outstanding service,\" the team said in a statement. \"He has touched so many lives around the game of baseball and his contributions to the Astros will always be remembered. We wish Dennis and Geraldine the very best.\" After stints working in the clubhouses of the Boston Red Sox and Los Angeles Dodgers, Liborio joined the Astros as clubhouse manager in November of 1979. He would hold onto that role for the duration of his time with Houston.   Liborio was well respected by the players, which is important considering he was in charge of handing out uniforms and equipment. He was a part of all nine playoff teams in franchise history, culminating with a trip to the World Series in 2005.   \"He's one of my best friends in the game of baseball and he's done so many amazing things with the Astros,\" former Astros second baseman Craig Biggio said. \"Behind every successful baseball team is the clubhouse guy. For the last 30-something years, we've had the best. He's going to be missed.   \"I'm just going to miss seeing him around every day. I will remember when I was a younger kid, the older players said, 'I'm going to tell you something, kid, you've got the best guy in the business.' I didn't know who was good or bad. After 20 years of being around him, I knew he was the best. The Astros are going to miss him dearly.\"   Liborio was a part of 56 postseason games, more than 900 Spring Training games and the 2004 All-Star Game, played at Minute Maid Park. In 2011, the Major League Baseball equipment managers association presented Liborio with a ring prior to an Astros game at Minute Maid Park to recognize his long, distinguished career in baseball.   The players had so much respect for Liborio that it wasn't uncommon for a former Astros player to make his way to the visiting clubhouse on a trip back through Houston for a chance to sit in Liborio's office and talk.   \"Dennis was an old-school baseball man that I looked forward to seeing everyday at the stadium,\" former Astros catcher Brad Ausmus said. \"I've missed him since leaving Houston, and will always wish him nothing but the best.\"   Here are some additional reactions to Liborio's retirement, courtesy of the Astros:   \"Dennis is one of a kind. Of the countless people I've met in the game, he is among my favorites. It just won't be the same without him in that clubhouse. As players, he was our team 'Mom' ... not afraid to give you grief, but always had your back.\" -- Jim Deshaies, current Astros TV analyst and Astros pitcher from 1985-91.   \"Dennis Liborio is an Astros institution. His many years of faithful service to the organization are greatly appreciated by the players he has helped during his tenure. Thank you, Dennis, for all you have done for me and so many others. The clubhouse won't be the same without you.\" -- Lance Berkman, Astros 1B-OF from 1999-2010.   \"I felt like Dennis was one of the top equipment and clubhouse managers that I ever worked with. He always had a real passion for the game and was truly committed to the organization. I hope he enjoys his retirement.\" -- Nolan Ryan, Astros pitcher from 1980-88 and current Texas Rangers CEO & president.   \"Dennis was wonderful to us. There was never a dull moment in that clubhouse, no matter how bad you were going. He was so much fun to be with, but was always so on top of everything. We appreciated him because he honestly cared about us. I miss him more than anyone I was with in Houston.\" -- Bill Doran, Astros infielder from 1982-90.   \"When I got to Houston in 1990, we had a young team those first few years and Dennis was a father figure to a lot of us. He really took care of us. We had so much fun sitting in his office, listening to him holding court and telling great stories. He was incredible to us. Over the years, our families built a strong bond and even shared season tickets for the Aeros games since Dennis loved hockey so much.\" -- Luis Gonzalez, Astros outfielder from 1990-95.   \"Dennis will be greatly missed. He brought me to Houston with him and is the reason I am here today. I love the guy and appreciate everything he has done for me and for the Astros.\" -- Barry Waters, Astros longtime traveling secretary who also worked with Liborio in the Dodgers clubhouse prior to coming to Houston in November 1979.
