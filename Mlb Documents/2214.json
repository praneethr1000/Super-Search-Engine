    "body": "CLEVELAND -- There is a long list of players who attended Ohio State University and later reached the Major Leagues. Indians first baseman Nick Swisher might be the only one to have incorporated spelling out O-H-I-O with his arms into his on-field act. On Monday night, Swisher watched his Buckeyes claim the first College Football Playoff National Championship with a 42-20 rout over Oregon in Arlington. The energetic and outspoken Swisher stayed quiet on social media during the game, but showed his Ohio State pride in the immediate aftermath of the victory. \"Way to get it done men!\" Swisher tweeted. \"So PROUD of our guys and proud to be a BUCKEYE! Great effort by Oregon, it was just our year!\" Way to get it done men!! So PROUD of our guys and proud to be a BUCKEYE! Great effort by Oregon, it was just our year! @OhioStAthletics Swisher, whose Twitter handle is @NickSwisher, then posted a message for Buckeyes head coach Urban Meyer. \"Great job @OSUCoachMeyer!!! When everyone said we couldn't!!! #nationalchamps,\" Swisher wrote. Great job @OSUCoachMeyer!!! When everyone said we couldn't!!! #nationalchamps Before Swisher signed a four-year contract with the Indians prior to the 2013 season, Meyer contributed to a video message that played at Progressive Field, trying to convince the first baseman and corner outfielder to join the Tribe. Former Ohio State football coach Jim Tressel was there in person on the day the Indians brought Swisher and his family to Cleveland three offseasons ago. Swisher was born in Columbus and returned to the city to attend Ohio State from 2000-02. While playing baseball for the Buckeyes, Swisher was named the Big Ten Freshman of the Year in 2000 and was an All-Conference selection in '01 and '02. In November 2011, Ohio State dedicated its baseball field to him, renaming the diamond Nick Swisher Field at Bill Davis Stadium. Before Monday's game, Swisher tweeted: \"It's go time! Let's bring home a National Championship tonight!\" Ohio State is 2-0 on days when we post this @NickSwisher picture. So ... here ya go! Good luck, @OhioStAthletics! pic.twitter.com\/RatEy6ChIm The Buckeyes did not disappoint, clinching their first national title since 2002. Indians second baseman Jason Kipnis attended the game in Texas and posted a picture of himself with Tressel on his Twitter page (@TheJK_Kid) during the football game. Kipnis captioned the photo: \"The man, the myth, the legend, the vest!\" The man, the myth, the legend, the vest! #tressel #stud #gobucks #OH http:\/\/t.co\/pAL6V7irza Jordan Bastian is a reporter for MLB.com.
