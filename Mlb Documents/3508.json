    "body": "SEATTLE -- Randy Johnson and Dan Wilson, who teamed together in Seattle through much of the 1990s, will be inducted into the Mariners Hall of Fame together this summer, the team announced Tuesday.  It's a fitting honor for a pitcher and catcher who teamed together for some of the franchise's biggest moments, including a playoff-clinching win in a one-game tiebreaker over the Angels in 1995 that both reflect on as the brightest memory in their Seattle careers.  Wilson leaped into Johnson's arms after they'd struck out Tim Salmon for the final out of that game and elevated the Mariners into their first postseason series in franchise history. Now they'll advance together into the Mariners Hall of Fame, becoming the fifth and sixth members, with their induction ceremony set for Saturday, July 28, prior to a game against the Royals at Safeco Field.
