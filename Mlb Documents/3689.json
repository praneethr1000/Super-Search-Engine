    "body": "SAN FRANCISCO -- Tim Lincecum's penchant for setting new standards has extended to economics. The Giants right-hander is seeking $21.5 million in salary arbitration, barely short of the record $22 million that Houston's Roger Clemens requested in 2005. San Francisco countered with a $17 million offer Tuesday as teams exchanged figures for one-year contract proposals with arbitration-eligible players. That's the largest arbitration offer any club has made, eclipsing the New York Yankees' $14.25 million offer to Derek Jeter in 2001. Asked whether the Giants would again suggest multiyear options, Evans said, \"You always explore, simultaneously, different scenarios. ... I can't really predict where it will end up.\" Chris Haft is a reporter for MLB.com. This story was not subject to the approval of Major League Baseball or its clubs.",
