    "body": "MIAMI -- Spring Training is just around the corner for the Marlins, but the first time the club will take the field is being pushed back a day. The Marlins on Friday announced a slight change to the start of Spring Training. Pitchers and catchers officially begin working out on Feb. 12 at 10 a.m. ET. Previously, the start date was set for Feb. 11. The date for the beginning of full-squad workouts remains the same, set for Feb. 15. The Marlins will be entering their 11th Spring Training at the Roger Dean Stadium complex in Jupiter, Fla.  Once workouts get under way, fans will see the introduction of Mike Redmond as Miami's manager. Formerly a backup catcher, Redmond played for the Marlins from 1998-2004.  The Marlins will play 32 exhibition games in Spring Training, with the first coming on Feb. 23, when they host the Cardinals at 1:05 p.m. in Jupiter. Joe Frisaro is a reporter for MLB.com.
