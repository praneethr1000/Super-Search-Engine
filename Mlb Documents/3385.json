    "body": "PHILADELPHIA -- The Phillies lightened their organizational outfielder inventory Wednesday, trading Chris Roberson to the Orioles for cash. The 28-year-old spent most of last season with Triple-A Ottawa, batting .266 in 113 games while playing primarily in center field. He adds depth to the Orioles, who will be auditioning replacements for anticipated free-agent departure Corey Patterson. In two stints with Philadelphia in 2007, Roberson hit .286 (8-for-28) in 28 games. He will be remembered by Phillies fans for his play as a defensive replacement in a critical Sept. 5 loss in Atlanta. Ken Mandel is a reporter for MLB.com.
