    "body": "CINCINNATI -- The Reds parted with a lot of young talent this offseason to make trades meant to help the club in the here and now. But the cupboard is not bare.  Two Reds prospects -- catcher Devin Mesoraco and shortstop Billy Hamilton -- were ranked among the 100 players on MLB.com's 2012 Top Prospects list. The list, which is one of several prospect rankings on MLB.com's Prospect Watch, only includes players with rookie status in 2012.  Mesoraco was listed at No. 14 while Hamilton was at No. 34. For Mesoraco, who was ranked 45th on last year's list, his time to prove himself in the Majors is upon him. He will come to Spring Training expected to make the team and share catching duties with veteran Ryan Hanigan this season.        Mesoraco, 23, batted .180 for the Reds with two home runs and three doubles. At Triple-A Louisville last season, he batted .289 with 15 homers and 71 RBIs. After initially struggling upon becoming a pro player, he has developed a good routine at the plate and has demonstrated that he can be a dangerous hitter with power.
