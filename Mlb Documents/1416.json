    "body": "ARLINGTON -- Yu Darvish was 16-9 with a 3.90 ERA and 221 strikeouts in 29 starts for the Rangers last season. He didn't sound particularly thrilled about his season.  \"There were some rough times, some good times as well,\" Darvish said. \"Overall, just so-so.\"  The Rangers might take \"so-so\" from Darvish every year, especially since he's not sure if he can do better than that.
