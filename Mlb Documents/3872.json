    "body": "HOUSTON -- The Astros plan to hold their annual Nolan Ryan Elite Pitching Camp and Jeff Bagwell Elite Hitting Camp at the end of the month, but they may be without one of their coaches -- Roger Clemens.  No decisions have been made yet, but the Astros are considering not including Clemens as a coach during the week-long mini-camp for the organization's top prospects. The camps will be held Jan. 28-31 at Minute Maid Park.  If they exclude Clemens, it will not be because the club is presuming guilt. But after Clemens' name appeared in the Mitchell Report on Dec. 13, the Astros front office discussed that it might be better for Clemens to not participate in the camp, because of the potential distractions that could accompany the Rocket's presence at the ballpark, due to the crush of media that certainly would follow. \"When the Mitchell Report came out, we talked about it,\" assistant general manager Ricky Bennett said. \"[Club owner] Drayton [McLane] had the mindset of, 'Let's see how this thing plays out.' That was weeks ago. I don't know. My thoughts are it would be real awkward. If he does come, it'll be world news. We don't want that kind of distraction. We'll talk about it.\"  General manager Ed Wade made it clear there have been no discussions about Clemens' participation at the camp.   \"It's two-plus weeks away and Ricky's been spending all of his time putting the roster and schedule together,\" Wade said. \"There haven't been any internal discussions about Roger, and we haven't had any discussions with Roger.\"  Clemens has participated in the camp every year, and it was understood that the Rocket would continue to do so as part of the 10-year personal services contract he signed four years ago. The contract was to go into effect when Clemens officially retired, which he has not done yet.  In the Mitchell Report, Clemens was alleged to have used steroids and human growth hormone in 1998, 2000 and 2001. His former trainer, Brian McNamee, told Sen. George Mitchell he injected Clemens several times during those three seasons.   Clemens has vehemently issued several denials, through written statements, a video posted on his Web site, a \"60 Minutes\" interview and a press conference with reporters in Houston.   Clemens has also filed a defamation suit against McNamee for making \"false and defamatory\" claims in the Mitchell Report.   Clemens' son, Koby, a prospect in the Astros' system, plans to participate in the Elite Camp. Because the Astros will limit media access to players to certain parts of each day, Bennett does not anticipate any distractions even if reporters seek out Clemens' eldest son.   But the Rocket would be a different story, which may move the club to decide not to invite Clemens to serve as a coach at this year's camp.   \"With all the hoopla and coverage, the focus should be on our players,\" Bennett said. \"Nolan, Bagwell, the group itself. Not the other things.\" Alyson Footer is a reporter for MLB.com. This story was not subject to the approval of Major League Baseball or its clubs.",
