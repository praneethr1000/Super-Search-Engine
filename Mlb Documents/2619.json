    "body": "The Red Sox signed outfielder Quintin Berry, left-hander Dana Eveland, first baseman\/outfielder Bryan LaHair, righty Felipe Paulino and catcher Humberto Quintero to Minor League contracts Thursday. All five players received invitations to big league Spring Training. Berry previously spent part of the 2013 season in the organization and appeared in three postseason games, stealing three bases as a pinch-runner during Boston's drive to a World Series title. The 30-year-old played in 10 games for the Orioles last season, spending most of his time at Triple-A Norfolk, where he hit .285\/.382\/.367 with 25 steals. Eveland, 31, has worked as a starter at times over parts of nine big league seasons, but he will come to camp as a reliever. He had success in that role last year for the Mets, posting a 2.63 ERA over 27 1\/3 innings, striking out 27 and walking six. LaHair was a 2012 National League All-Star with the Cubs, but he struggled down the stretch that year and hasn't played in the Majors since. He spent '13 in Japan and '14 in the Indians' system, mostly at Double-A Akron, hitting .234\/.324\/.332 with five homers and 60 RBIs in 101 games. Paulino, 31, also will enter the spring as a reliever, though he has started 65 of his 97 Major League appearances. He underwent Tommy John surgery in 2012 and made only four starts for the White Sox last year before spending the rest of the season on the disabled list with shoulder problems. Quintero is a 12-year veteran who has played 471 games for five teams while hitting .234\/.267\/.327. The 35-year-old played in three games for the Mariners last season while spending the bulk of his time at Triple-A Tacoma. Andrew Simon is a reporter for MLB.com.
