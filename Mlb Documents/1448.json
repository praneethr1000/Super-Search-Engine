    "body": "MILWAUKEE -- All-Star outfielder Ryan Braun and all three of the Brewers' new relievers were among 50 current, former and future players confirmed Thursday to attend the team's annual \"On Deck\" event later this month.  Besides Braun, the Brewers announced that relievers Burke Badenhop, Michael Gonzalez and Tom Gorzelanny would attend, as would broadcaster Bob Uecker and top 2012 Draft picks Clint Coulter, Victor Roache and Mitch Haniger.  On Deck, scheduled for Sunday, Jan. 27, at Milwaukee's downtown convention center, is the club's annual fanfest, with autograph and photo opportunities, interactive forums with coaches and players, memorabilia sales and baseball activities for kids. Advance tickets are $15 for adults and $9 for kids, and are on sale at Brewers.com\/OnDeck. The full list of participants includes current 40-man roster members John Axford, Badenhop, Jeff Bianchi, Braun, Nick Bucci, Hiram Burgos, Khris Davis, Marco Estrada, Mike Fiers, Yovani Gallardo, Mat Gamel, Scooter Gennett, Caleb Gindl, Carlos Gomez, Gonzalez, Gorzelanny, Taylor Green, Corey Hart, Johnny Hellweg, Jim Henderson, Brandon Kintzler, Jonathan Lucroy, Martin Maldonado, Chris Narveson, Michael Olmsted, Wily Peralta, Josh Prince, Mark Rogers, Logan Schafer, Josh Stinson, Tyler Thornburg and Rickie Weeks. Missing from that list, at least for now, are starting third baseman Aramis Ramirez, shortstop Jean Segura and right fielder Norichika Aoki.   Manager Ron Roenicke and his entire coaching staff will attend, as will former Brewers Jerry Augustine, Jim Gantner, Larry Hisle and Gorman Thomas, and prospects Coulter, Kentrail Davis, Drew Gagnon, Haniger, Taylor Jungmann, Hunter Morris, Jimmy Nelson and Roache.   A club official said the full autograph schedule would be announced at a later date, but that the system in place for previous On Deck events would hold. Some signers will be labeled \"premier,\" and their autograph available via a random selection process with numbered coupons, which will be distributed beginning at 8 a.m. CT at the Delta Center. Coupon distribution will be available up to an hour before each designated autograph session.   Fans can receive one coupon per event admission ticket and can use that coupon to enter the random selection process for any one of the select players. There is no cost for coupons to enter the random selection process; however, those holding one of the 250 coupons that are chosen must pay $25 at the respective autograph stage to collect their player signature, with all autograph proceeds going to the Brewers Community Foundation.   Players and staff not included in the premier autograph list will not use the random selection process. Each of these players will sign 250 autographs at prices ranging from free to $10. The autograph opportunities are for signatures on photo cards provided by the team -- the Brewers say they cannot guarantee that any player will sign other memorabilia.Â    The club's announcement noted that cash is the only acceptable form of payment for autographs.
