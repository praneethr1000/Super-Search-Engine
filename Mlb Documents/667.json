    "body": "CHICAGO -- Javier Baez says he doesn't mind making the switch from the infield to center field. All he wants to do is help the Cubs. Playing for Santurce in the Puerto Rican Winter League, Baez, 23, started four of his 15 total games in center field as part of an experiment. The hope is that he could become a versatile player and move around the diamond. Baez, attending the Cubs Convention on Friday, said the switch to center was easier than the one from shortstop to second base. \"Back in center field, I can relax and worry about hitting,\" Baez said. \"I thought it was going to be hard or different, but I had a game where they hit seven fly balls out there, and I caught all of them, routine. I feel really good.\" The Cubs sent Minor League outfield coach Doug Dascenzo to Puerto Rico to work with Baez, who has yet to talk to manager Joe Maddon or anyone in the front office about making the move permanently. Baez was back at second base during the round-robin playoffs. \"Wherever I'm at, I'll just do my job,\" said Baez, who will rejoin Santurce and continue to play in Puerto Rico until Jan. 20.
