    "subtitle": "",
    "body": "The A's have agreed to terms on a one-year, $1,087,500 million contract with reliever Fernando Abad, thus avoiding arbitration. The left-hander posted a 1.57 ERA in a career-high 69 appearances last year with the A's, allowing just 13.2 percent (5-of-38) of inherited runners to score. He ranked third among American League relievers in percentage of inherited runners who scored, fifth in ERA and seventh in opponents' slugging percentage (.253). Opposing batters hit .175 against him overall. Oakland has two remaining players -- Tyler Clippard and Jarrod Parker -- eligible for arbitration. Joey Nowak is a reporter for MLB.com.
