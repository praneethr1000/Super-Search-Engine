    "body": "BOSTON -- What Bill Russell wants people to remember about Jackie Robinson is not the color of his skin but the strength of his character.  On the first day of Black History Month, the Red Sox hosted a panel that included the Boston Celtics legend to elaborate on the Robinson legacy in baseball and on society today.  \"We all know that fear was never a motivator for Jackie Robinson,\" Russell told the audience on Friday at Fenway Park's EMC Club. \"Jackie's success was based on, not obstacles, but opportunities. He saw everything as a chance to do what he knew he could do.\" Mike Petraglia is a contributor to MLB.com. This story was not subject to the approval of Major League Baseball or its clubs.",
