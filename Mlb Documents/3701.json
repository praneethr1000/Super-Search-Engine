    "body": "The Mets were able to take care of deals with all four of their arbitration-eligible players on Tuesday, inking Mike Pelfrey, Andres Torres, Ramon Ramirez and Manny Acosta each to one-year deals. The Mets have gone to arbitration just once in the past 20 years -- with Oliver Perez in 2008. Pelfrey comes away with the weightiest deal, valued at $5.68 million. The 28-year-old right-hander has spent all six of his big league seasons with the Mets, tallying a 50-54 record and a 4.40 ERA for his career. He was 7-13 in 2011, after winning at least 10 games in each of the three previous years. Torres, 33, will be in his first season with the Mets after spending the past three in the Giants' outfield. His contract is worth $2.7 million.  Ramirez, who was acquired in the same Dec. 7, 2011, deal that brought Torres to New York and sent Angel Pagan to San Francisco, will make $2.67 million. The right-hander was 3-3 with a 2.62 ERA in 66 appearances last season out of the Giants' bullpen.  Acosta, signed for $875,000, will be in his sixth season, and he is 12-10 with a 3.41 ERA in his career. He has spent the past two seasons with the Mets and was 4-1 last year in 44 games.
