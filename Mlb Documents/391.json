    "body": "Ichiro Suzuki is one of the most confident players in Major League Baseball, so it was not surprising when he said he had plenty of faith in the chances of his Japanese team winning the upcoming inaugural World Baseball Classic.  Ichiro, the Seattle Mariners right fielder and perennial All-Star, has been working out in Japan in recent weeks to get ready for the March tournament. He told the Japanese Associated Press that he has a few things to take care of before the start of the Mariners' 2006 campaign.  \"With the World Baseball Classic, this year is a bit different,\" Ichiro told the AP. \"Our goal will be to win the tournament, and after that I'll start thinking about the regular season.\" On Wednesday, the names of the 54 players -- including Ichiro -- on the initial 60-man Japanese roster for the WBC were announced.   And although Ichiro and Texas Rangers reliever Akinori Otsuka are the Major League names that highlight the list, the Japanese team might get more attention for the players who aren't on that list.   Yankees outfielder Hideki Matsui, for example, could have been a huge force in the middle of the Japanese lineup, but he opted to pull out of Classic consideration in December despite the wishes of Japanese legend and manager Sadaharu Oh.   \"The reason I decided to go to the United States was to try and become a world champion with the Yankees,\" Kyodo News quoted Matsui as saying in a statement at the time. \"And I fear that chasing two goals might get in the way of that dream.\"   Matsui signed a four-year, $52 million contract with the Yankees in November and was under a lot of pressure in Japan to play in the event, but he withstood the pressure and said no.   \"It is disappointing, but as with declaring free agency, it is the individual's decision,\" Oh told reporters in Tokyo at the time.   Another decision that could be viewed as disappointing to Japanese fans was made by second-year Chicago White Sox second baseman Tadahito Iguchi, who announced a week ago that he, too, would not participate in the WBC.   \"Unfortunately, I've decided to withdraw from the squad,\" Iguchi said while training in Japan's southernmost island of Okinawa, Kyodo News reported. \"This is the second year of my two-year contract with the White Sox. The team expects more from me than in the first year, so I would have to be in Spring Training.\"   Other current or former Japanese Major Leaguers not on the 54-man list include new Mariners catcher Kenji Johjima, Mets infielder Kazuo Matsui, Dodgers infielder Norihiro Nakamura, Cardinals outfielder So Taguchi, pitchers Hideo Nomo, Kazuhisa Ishii, Tomo Ohka and Keiichi Yabu, and relievers Shigetoshi Hasegawa, Shingo Takatsu and Kazuhiro Sasaki.   Despite the fact that these players will not be on the team, Ichiro said there still is reason to be confident that the team will perform well.   \"I've seen a lot of great plays in my five years in the Majors,\" said Ichiro. \"And I know we have enough talent on our team to be able to contend.\"   Some of that talent will come from Kosuki Fukudome, the Chunichi Dragons outfielder who will likely take Hideki Matsui's place on Japan's 30-man roster. Fukudome, the 2002 Central League batting champion, batted .328 with 28 homers and a career-high 103 RBIs in 132 games last season for the Dragons.   Other Japan-based stars on the roster include first baseman Nobuhiko Matsunaka of the Fukuoka SoftBank Hawks, right-hander Koji Uehara of the Yomiuri Giants, lefty Shugo Fujii of the Yakult Swallows and infielder Michihiro Ogasawara of the Hokkaido Nippon-Ham Fighters.   No other names can be added to these rosters for injuries or any other reason, so the final teams will be made up of players from these rosters only. Provisional rosters allow Federations to list up to 60 players from which final 30-man rosters will be selected. Each Federation must submit its final roster, including a minimum of 13 pitchers and three catchers, prior to the start of the World Baseball Classic.   The 16-team WBC, sanctioned by the International Baseball Federation (IBAF), will take place March 3-20 and feature the world's best players competing for their home countries and territories for the first time. Fans will be able to follow all the games live exclusively online at MLB.com.   First-round action will be played at four sites. Pool A, consisting of Japan, Korea, Chinese Taipei and China, will meet at the Tokyo Dome, March 3-5. Pool B, featuring USA, Canada, Mexico and South Africa will play at Chase Field, home of the Arizona Diamondbacks, and Scottsdale Stadium, Spring Training home of the San Francisco Giants, March 9-11. Pool C is Puerto Rico, Cuba, Panama and the Netherlands, and will play at Hiram Bithorn Stadium in San Juan, Puerto Rico, March 9-11. Pool D, featuring the Dominican Republic, Venezuela, Australia and Italy will play at the Disney Wide World of Sports Complex in Orlando, Florida, March 9-11.   The top two teams from each pool will advance to the second round, which takes place March 13-15 at Hiram Bithorn Stadium in Puerto Rico and Angel Stadium in Anaheim. The semifinals and finals will be held at San Diego's PETCO Park, March 18-20.  Doug Miller is a reporter for MLB.com.
