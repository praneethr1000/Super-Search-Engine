    "body": "The Royals have reached an agreement with third baseman Kevin Kouzmanoff on a Minor League contract and an invitation to Major League camp.  According to ESPN's Jerry Crasnick, Kouzmanoff will earn a base salary of $1 million if he makes the big league roster and incentives could increase the value of his deal to as much as $1.3 million. There is also a provision in the contract that allows for Kouzmanoff to request a release if he's still in the Minors on May 1.  The 30-year-old right-handed hitter has spent parts of six seasons with the Indians, Padres, A's and Rockies. He has hit .255 with 85 homers in his career. He hit .235 with seven homers and 33 RBIs last season while playing for Oakland and Colorado.   Kouzmanoff set a National League single-season record for third basemen with a .990 fielding percentage while playing for the Padres in 2009, though he did not win a Gold Glove.  â€ªJoey Nowak is a reporter for MLB.com.
