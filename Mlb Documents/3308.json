    "body": "NEW YORK -- The Yankees announced on Wednesday that they have signed outfielder Preston Mattingly, the son of franchise icon Don Mattingly, to a Minor League contract.  The 24-year-old Mattingly played at two levels with the Los Angeles Dodgers organization in 2011, hitting .232 (38-for-164) with five doubles, five home runs and 19 RBIs in 53 combined games with Class A Great Lakes and Class A Advanced Rancho Cucamonga.  Originally drafted by the Dodgers in Compensation Round A of the 2006 First-Year Player Draft, Mattingly has compiled a Minor League batting average of .232 in six seasons in the Dodgers and Indians organizations. He will report to Minor League Spring Training, the Yankees said.   The elder Mattingly, entering his second season as the Dodgers' manager, played his entire 14-year career in Yankees pinstripes from 1982-95.   A career .307 hitter, Mattingly won the 1985 American League MVP Award, earning six All-Star selections and nine Gold Glove Awards. His uniform No. 23 was retired by the club in 1997.   Another of Mattingly's sons has also played in the Yankees system. New York selected Taylor Mattingly in the 42nd round of the 2003 First-Year Player Draft, and he played 24 games in the organization that year. Bryan Hoch is a reporter for MLB.com.
