    "body": "ST. PETERSBURG -- The Devil Rays and Travis Harper agreed to a one-year, $850,000 Major League contract Monday, thereby avoiding the possibility of going to an arbitration hearing.  Harper, 29, led the Rays' bullpen with 73 1\/3 innings pitched in 2005 while going 4-6 with a 6.75 ERA in 52 games. His 210 career appearances with the Rays are the second most in club history, trailing only Esteban Yan's 266. Harper's 245 innings pitched over the last three seasons rank fourth in the Majors.  After signing Harper, the Rays have just two remaining arbitration-eligible players: catcher Josh Paul and first baseman Travis Lee. Bill Chastain is a reporter for MLB.com.
