    "body": "ST. LOUIS -- Josh Phelps signed a Minor League deal with the Cardinals on Thursday, providing the club with an intriguing bat off the bench at best, and Triple-A production at worst.  Phelps received an invitation to big league Spring Training, where he will compete for a roster spot on what would be his sixth Major League team. The first baseman\/catcher split 2007 between the Pirates and Yankees, putting up an impressive overall line of .306\/.399\/.503 with seven home runs and 31 RBIs in 157 at-bats.  He has played almost exclusively first base and designated hitter in the Major Leagues, but Phelps was drafted as a catcher and the Cardinals believe he could still potentially be used as a third catcher. For his career, Phelps is a .273 hitter with a .344 on-base percentage and a .476 slugging percentage. He's hit 64 home runs in 1,360 career Major League at-bats.   Phelps comes into a tight squeeze, roster-wise. The Cardinals already have seven infielders to squeeze into six spots, plus Minor Leaguers Brian Barden and Jarrett Hoffpauir competing for opportunities.  Matthew Leach is a reporter for MLB.com.
