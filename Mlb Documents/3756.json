    "body": "CHICAGO -- Fans of the late Chuck Tanner's 1972 White Sox squad, featuring Dick Allen, Bill Melton and Wilbur Wood, to name a few, will get a 40-year memory jog this year on Sundays at U.S. Cellular Field when the 2012 team wears uniforms similar to those that group wore.  The uniforms will feature the red pinstriped jersey with the iconic \"Sox\" script over the chest, red numbers (front and back) and a White Sox patch on the sleeve, along with the popular red cap with its unique variation of the Sox script. The White Sox will wear the throwback uniforms on 13 Sundays this season, starting with April 15 vs. Detroit.   \"Being a part of those early 1970s White Sox teams, with a leader like Chuck Tanner and exciting players such as Dick Allen, Wilbur Wood and a young Goose Gossage, remains one of the fondest times in my career,\" Melton said in a press release to announce the throwback jerseys. \"The red pinstripes and red baseball cap will bring back a lot of great memories for Sox fans from that generation.\" As Melton mentioned, that 1972 team featured Gossage, the future Hall of Famer, as well as Terry Forster, Carlos May and Jorge Orta. Allen won the 1972 American League Most Valuable Player award for the 87-67 White Sox, who finished second in the AL West behind the A's. He led the AL with 37 homers, 113 RBIs, 99 walks, a .420 on-base percentage and a .603 slugging percentage.   Wood topped the AL in wins with 24, as well as with an amazing 376 2\/3 innings pitched and 49 starts. As part of this year's White Sox promotional schedule, the first 10,000 children 13 and under will receive a 1972 replica jersey on Sunday, June 24, when the White Sox host Milwaukee.   Individual-game tickets to 2012 Chicago White Sox home games at U.S. Cellular go on sale to the general public on Friday, Feb. 3, at 10:00 a.m. CT on whitesox.com.
