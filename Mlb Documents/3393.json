    "body": "NEW YORK -- The Mets will host the 2013 All-Star Game at Citi Field, according to multiple published reports. It will mark the second time in history the Mets will host the Midsummer Classic, and the first time since 1964 during Shea Stadium's inaugural season. No Major League franchise has gone longer without hosting an All-Star Game.  It will also be the first All-Star week in New York since the Yankees hosted the 2008 game in their final season at the old Yankee Stadium.  Reports of Citi Field hosting the game first leaked early last year, though neither the Mets nor Major League Baseball have acknowledged it publicly. An official announcement may not come for several months. This year's All-Star Game will take place in Phoenix; next year's is slated for Kansas City. Anthony DiComo is a reporter for MLB.com.
