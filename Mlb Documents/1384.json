    "body": "KANSAS CITY -- Pitcher Luke Hochevar is the only Royals player among 133 Major Leaguers who filed for salary arbitration on Tuesday. Players and the clubs will exchange salary figures on Friday, and hearings, if necessary, will be held Feb. 4-20. Typically, the majority of cases are settled before a hearing. Hochevar settled his arbitration case last year for $3.51 million. He finished the season with an 8-16 record and a 5.73 ERA in 32 starts. This year, an influx of starting pitchers has put him in a position of battling for the last spot in a five-man rotation behind James Shields, Jeremy Guthrie, Ervin Santana and Wade Davis.
