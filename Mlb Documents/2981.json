    "body": "NEW YORK -- The Yankees are continuing to stockpile pitching depth with Spring Training approaching, agreeing to terms with right-hander Manny Delcarmen on a Minor League contract that includes an invitation to camp. The New York Post first reported the Yanks' signing of Delcarmen, who has previously seen big league duty with the Red Sox and Rockies. Delcarmen, who turns 30 on Feb. 16, did not pitch in the Major Leagues in 2011. He was 3-2 with a 5.59 ERA in 26 combined appearances for the Triple-A affiliates of the Mariners and Rangers. Owning a career record of 11-8 with a 3.97 ERA in 298 big league appearances from 2005-10, Delcarmen made all but nine of those appearances in a Boston uniform. He has struck out 249 batters in 292 2\/3 big league innings.  Delcarmen is the third former Red Sox reliever to be added to the Yankees' mix this winter. New York obtained left-hander Cesar Cabral in December's Rule 5 Draft, by way of the Royals, and also signed veteran left-hander Hideki Okajima to a Minor League contract with an invitation to Spring Training.
