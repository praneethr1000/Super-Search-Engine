    "body": "Reds utility player Ryan Freel was arrested early Sunday morning in Tampa, Fla., and charged with disorderly intoxication, according to the Cincinnati Enquirer.  Attributing from a report by the Hillsborough County jail, the newspaper said that Freel was arrested at 3:35 a.m., refused to take a breathalyzer test and listed his occupation as \"unemployed.\" The charge is a second-degree misdemeanor, and the 29-year-old was released later in the day on a $250 bond.  Freel was re-signed by Cincinnati to a two-year contract worth a guaranteed $3 million on Dec. 19. He batted .271 with three home runs and 21 RBIs in 103 games during the 2005 season.
