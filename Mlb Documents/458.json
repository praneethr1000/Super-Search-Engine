    "body": "MINNEAPOLIS -- Driving alongside the Metrodome on Friday night, Twins manager Ron Gardenhire couldn't quite believe what he saw.  \"There was a line halfway around the building at around 5:15 waiting to get in,\" Gardenhire said. \"It was amazing to see the excitement that the fans have.\"  Exactly what was making Twins fans wait in such long lines to enter the Metrodome was none other than the start of the 2006 TwinsFest. Doors opened to the public at around 5:30 p.m., but the excitement generated by the annual event was enough to make fans line up well before then. Kelly Thesier  is a reporter for MLB.com.
