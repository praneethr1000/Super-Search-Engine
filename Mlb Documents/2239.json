    "subtitle": "",
    "body": "The A's have agreed to a one-year deal with right-hander Jesse Chavez reportedly worth $2.15 million, avoiding arbitration with the 31-year-old. Chavez began the season in the starting rotation in 2014, and had a 3.44 ERA in 21 starts before he was moved to the bullpen when Oakland acquired Jon Lester in July. Chavez had a 3.54 ERA in 11 relief appearances during the second half. He is coming off a year with career highs in strikeouts (136) and innings (146) and a career-low ERA (3.45). Chavez is likely to serve as a middle reliever in 2015, the role he has filled for much of his career. The A's now have eight players that remain eligible for arbitration: Fernando Abad, Ryan Cook, Sam Fuld, Craig Gentry, Brett Lawrie, Jarrod Parker, Josh Reddick and Eric Sogard.
