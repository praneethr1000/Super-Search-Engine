    "body": "CHICAGO -- Jerry Hairston was not 100 percent healthy in 2005. He was coming off surgery on his left ankle in December 2004, which meant he spent the offseason prior to his first season with the Chicago Cubs rehabbing and not training. He simply couldn't run.  If Hairston had to put a percentage on how healthy he was, what would he say?  \"Seventy-five percent,\" Hairston said Saturday during a break at the Cubs Convention. \"My game is running.\" Which he couldn't do. Hairston finished with eight stolen bases in 114 games for the Cubs, batting .261. It wasn't exactly a great first impression. One of three players acquired from the Orioles for Sammy Sosa, Hairston said the Cubs knew about his weak ankle.   \"They were aware of it and knew what my role would be last year,\" said Hairston, who was projected as a backup infielder in 2005. \"I had the ankle surgery in December of [2004], and I had really just started to run before I got to Spring Training. I wasn't even at full strength. My ankle wasn't nearly as strong as it should've been.   \"As far as being able to run, I couldn't do it,\" he said. \"I went to steal bases, but it just wasn't there. My heart was in it.\"   If there was a positive to come out of the 2005 season, it's that the Cubs know how versatile Hairston is. He played all three outfield positions, and he made 36 starts at second base.   Today, Hairston is smiling, healthy, a new father and 100 percent.   \"I'm back to training, not rehabbing,\" he said. \"Now, I'm running the way I was three years ago. I feel like a new man.\"   Since November, he has been working with a track coach and training with two world-class sprinters who are preparing for the Olympics. Hairston has lost 12 pounds, and he is leaner and healthier.   \"It was really demoralizing being on that field at that level thinking there were things you used to do and can't do,\" he said. \"I've taken this offseason seriously. I'm very excited about the year -- very excited.\"   The Cubs' depth chart for 2006 lists three second baseman. Todd Walker and Neifi Perez also are in the mix.   \"My best friend on the team is Todd Walker,\" Hairston said. \"We talk once a week. We know what's going on. We started becoming friends when he was in Boston and I was in Baltimore. We used to work out together. We want to see each other be starting second basemen. I have a tremendous amount of respect for Walk. He's one of my good friends. If he's on this team right now, I'd say he's the starting second baseman.\"   And that is what Cubs manager Dusty Baker has hinted at, based on Walker being the starter in 2005. But the team also wants to improve on defense, and Hairston could have the edge over his buddy.   \"We don't look at it [as competition],\" Hairston said. \"We're competing against the guy on the mound. That's what we focus on.\"   In fact, Walker and Cubs first baseman Derrek Lee apparently were the only players who knew Hairston was hobbling last season.   In 2002, Hairston batted .268 for the Orioles with 21 stolen bases. The next season, he was hitting .271 with 14 thefts in 58 games before breaking a bone in his right foot.   \"I want to get back to where I was,\" Hairston said. \"With my quickness back and my feet finally healthy for the first time in three years, I'm really excited to get back on the field. I feel like I'm 25 again -- even though I'm still young at 29. I feel I'm ready to be myself again.\"   Hairston came up in the Orioles system, watching guys like Cal Ripken Jr. and Mike Bordick never miss a game because of aches or pains.   \"I don't make excuses. I still played on it,\" Hairston said. \"Even though I wasn't 100 percent, I did the best job I could. Now, I feel great and I'm ready to hit the ground running, literally.\"   So the Cubs will see a new Jerry Hairston in 2006?   \"I hope so,\" he said. \"You never know what the season brings, but I'm preparing myself the best I can. This is the best I've felt in three, four years. The running joke in Baltimore was that no one wanted to sit next to me because I was always getting hurt. [Going through the ups and downs of injuries and rehab] has made me a stronger person.   \"I'm excited not only for myself but for the team we have,\" he said. \"We have a leadoff hitter in Juan Pierre. My best year, I was batting second [behind Brian Roberts and ahead of Miguel Tejada]. I've always been comfortable hitting second.\"   What also has motivated Hairston and the Cubs this offseason is how the 2005 campaign ended. The Cubs could only watch as the Houston Astros clinched the National League Wild Card berth on the final weekend of play. Chicago finished in fourth place and under .500 at 79-83.   \"When we saw Houston celebrate on their home turf, we got a chance to look at that and it really left a bad taste in our mouths,\" Hairston said. \"We were a little embarrassed and we want to change that. We do not want to feel the same way we did last year.\" Carrie Muskat is a reporter for MLB.com. This story was not subject to the approval of Major League Baseball or its clubs.",
