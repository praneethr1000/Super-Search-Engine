    "body": "TOKYO -- Now that the Miami Marlins have signed Ichiro Suzuki, the Cincinnati Reds are the only team in Major League Baseball for which a Japanese player has never appeared. The Reds were the first team to gain a player from Japan through the posting system after it was created in December 1998. The player from Japan that Cincinnati outbid all other teams for in the secret bidding process was a Dominican. Pitcher Alejandro Quezada belonged to the Hiroshima Carp when they posted him before the 1999 season. The Reds won Quezada's negotiating rights with a bid of $400,000. Quezada, who later changed his surname to Diaz, pitched in the Minor Leagues for Cincinnati through 2003 without ever appearing in a Major League game. Masanori Murakami became MLB's first player from Japan when he pitched for San Francisco in 1964.
