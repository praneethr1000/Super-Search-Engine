    "body": "Paul Beeston will remain the Toronto Blue Jays' president and CEO through the end of the 2015 season. Rogers Communications made the announcement Monday night that Beeston signed a one-year contract extension with the organization, but with the caveat that he will retire at the end of the season. The announcement ends the pursuit of Orioles executive vice president of baseball operations Dan Duquette for Beeston's position. \"I love this ballclub and the fans,\" Beeston said in a news release. \"I wake up every day thinking about the game and bringing another championship north of the border. I'm excited for the season ahead -- we've got a great group of guys who are fiercely competitive and hope to be playing ball in October.\" Rogers had reportedly pursued Duquette and White Sox executive vice president Kenny Williams for the position, although the club did not confirm those reports. \"We have been in discussions with Paul about his future with the team since his contract expired in October,\" Blue Jays chairman Edward Rogers said in Monday's statement. \"There were many rumours flying about, but it would have been inappropriate to comment on such matters publicly. Make no mistake -- we are elated to have Paul continue to lead the team for this season.\" The Blue Jays said Beeston's successor will start when he retires, but they added they will not comment on the succession process or timing. A club spokesman did not anticipate Beeston making further comment Monday. Beeston, 69, has served two terms as the Blue Jays' president (1989-97 and 2008-present). He was the team's first employee in 1976 and has spent 31 years with the organization. Paul Beeston signs extension with @BlueJays.
