    "body": "MILWAUKEE -- What had been inevitable for months became reality on Tuesday. Prince Fielder, the big kid drafted by the Brewers nearly a decade ago who developed into one of baseball's best sluggers, has found a new home in baseball.  Fielder struck a nine-year, $214 million deal with the Detroit Tigers, first reported by CBSSports.com and pending a physical exam. When made official, it will end a Milwaukee tenure that dates back to June 2002, when a Brewers team in the midst of the worst season in franchise history made Fielder the seventh overall pick in the First-Year Player Draft.  Only right fielder Corey Hart has been with the organization longer. Fielder even predated general manager Doug Melvin, who was hired in September 2002 and on Tuesday called Fielder the cornerstone of the Brewers' return to relevance. \"In some sense, I'm glad he got a good contract that he's satisfied with. We knew early on that we probably weren't going to be in it. I think Prince probably knew that, too.\"                    Adam McCalvy is a reporter for MLB.com.
