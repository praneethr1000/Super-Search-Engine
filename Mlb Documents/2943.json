    "body": "KANSAS CITY -- Lane Adams and Yordano Ventura have won the top awards in the Royals' Minor League organization. Adams, a right-handed-hitting outfielder, was named George Brett Hitter of the Year. Ventura, a hard-throwing right-hander, was selected as the Paul Splittorff Pitcher of the Year. The pair will be honored during Spring Training. Both are on the Royals' 40-man Major League roster. Adams, 24, was also Player of the Year for Class A Advanced Wilmington. In 87 games for the Blue Rocks, he hit .276 with 23 doubles, seven home runs, 39 RBIs and 23 stolen bases. Promoted to Double-A Northwest Arkansas, he had a three-homer, seven-RBI game on Aug. 13 against Corpus Christi. In 44 games for the Naturals, Adams hit .244 with five homers and 26 RBIs. Adams was moved to Triple-A Omaha for the Pacific Coast League playoffs and went 3-for-5 with four RBIs as the Storm Chasers beat Salt Lake, 10-5, to win the championship. Ventura, 22, split most of his season between Northwest Arkansas and Omaha and totaled 155 strikeouts in 132 2\/3 innings for the two teams. In 26 games, his composite record was 8-6 with a 3.14 ERA -- including 2.34 at the Double-A level. Ventura made his Major League debut as a September callup with three starting assignments. In his first game, he was leading the Indians, 3-1, when he left the game in the sixth inning. He also grabbed attention with a fastball clocked at 102.8 mph, the fastest recorded by a Major League starting pitcher last season. Ventura is expected to compete for a rotation job with the Royals in camp. Dick Kaegel is a reporter for MLB.com. This story was not subject to the approval of Major League Baseball or its clubs.",
