    "body": "During the Winter Meetings, the potential contract for Albert Pujols received tremendous attention. Free agents like Jose Reyes and Heath Bell were signed by the Miami Marlins and introduced to the media at the same industry convention.  Major transactions involving star players help bring excitement to the game. Especially in the winter months. Fans watch carefully as their favorite team makes a move here, tweaks the roster there, or decides to wait until Spring Training to assess the club and determine the proper course of action. In some cases, the moves are small. Often transactions that seem insignificant are designed to complete a Minor League roster or provide organizational depth. Many players attempting to resurrect careers have signed contracts that include an invitation to Spring Training. Those transactions don't grab big headlines. However, those invitations are prized commodities.   Teams providing those Spring Training invitations hope to catch lightning in a bottle. For relatively low risk, the reward is great for both the player and the organizations involved.  Right-handed pitcher Andrew Brackman was a first-round selection in the 2007 First-Year Player Draft by the New York Yankees. Brackman had pitched for Carolina State University and was seen as capable of becoming a winning starting pitcher. At 6-foot-10 inches tall, the athletic Brackman played both basketball and baseball at N.C. State. A short time after signing his contract, Brackman underwent Tommy John surgery. Then his 2008 campaign was stalled by an appendectomy.   Brackman is a high velocity pitcher. He can bring his fastball at the mid to high-90's. He also has an above average curveball that may well be his best pitch. He has worked on a changeup and he continues to refine his slider. Completing his repertoire and having at least three quality pitches is important if he wants to remain a starter.   The issue? Brackman has had trouble commanding his pitches. He has struggled repeating his delivery and throwing strikes consistently. But at age 26, time remains for Brackman to continue developing control and a complete pitching repertoire.  The Cincinnati Reds claimed Brackman and they will give him a chance to establish his career in his hometown. He will be in Spring Training on a split Major League\/Minor League contract.  There are early indications the Cincinnati native will be pitching out of the bullpen. Brackman could eventually be the type of pitcher that is called upon to make an emergency start or work in long relief.  Regardless of his place on the pitching staff, Brackman is a very solid risk\/reward addition for the Reds. He will be surrounded by familiarity at home and will be given the opportunity to refine the skills that were attractive to the Yankees. Look for Brackman to contribute in Cincinnati.  Selected out of high school in the second round of the 2005 First-Year Player Draft by the Kansas City Royals, Jeff Bianchi showed the potential to play shortstop as well as second base. He's still only 25 years old.  At one point, Bianchi was a very highly-touted middle infielder in the Royals system. After fighting very difficult back and shoulder injuries in his first professional years, Bianchi's career was put on hold in 2010 when he had Tommy John surgery. It was the most recent interruption to his career. There is still hope for Bianchi to get back on track and become the hitter scouts profiled as a quality middle infielder.  Before being drafted, scouts compared Bianchi's offensive ability to that of Michael Young. They felt Bianchi would become a line-drive contact hitter with excellent bat control and enough power to drive the ball to the gaps. That hasn't happened.  Returning to baseball after recovering from the 2010 surgery, Bianchi did not have a great 2011 season for Double-A Northwest Arkansas. He hit .259 with only two home runs and 48 RBIs spanning 444 at-bats. Following the season, the Royals designated Bianchi for assignment. The Chicago Cubs claimed Bianchi on waivers and placed him on their 40-man roster.   Now, Bianchi projects exclusively as a second baseman because of the strain required by longer throws from shortstop.  If Bianchi can stay healthy, he could become a valuable asset to his new club. The injuries may have sapped him of strength, range of motion and overall energy. Bianchi has been given a chance to regain momentum.  Juan Miranda signed with the New York Yankees from Cuba in 2006. He was seen as a potential power-hitting first baseman that would hit well in Yankee Stadium. However, the arrival of Mark Teixeira via free agency relegated Miranda to Minor League status and he was ultimately dealt to the Arizona Diamondbacks before the 2010 season.  Kevin Towers, at that time the newly appointed general manager of the Diamondbacks, was familiar with Miranda from Towers' days working in the Yankees front office. Needing power for his reconstructed lineup, Towers turned to Miranda as a possible source for the long ball. Towers also had players such as Xavier Nady and Russell Branyan available to challenge for the first base position.   As a result, Miranda's at-bats were reduced in a platoon situation. He hit only .213 for the Diamondbacks with seven homers and 23 RBIs in 174 at-bats. Miranda was released in July. The first base position in Arizona ultimately was won by right-handed power-hitting Paul Goldschmidt.  Miranda, 6-feet and 220 pounds, is now 28 years old. He should be in the prime of his baseball life. It would be interesting to see how well he could hit if given a sustained opportunity. For a big power hitter, Miranda has a fairly disciplined approach at the plate and he doesn't get himself out chasing bad pitches. He scuffles against left-handed pitching, making him more of a true platoon first baseman, much the way he was deployed by Arizona.   But in Arizona, there were just too many players and not enough at-bats to go around. Branyan, also a left-handed hitter, took some of the at-bats against right-handed pitching. Miranda went days without playing and he looked rusty when opportunities arrived.  Trying to impress with limited chances tends to make players extend themselves beyond their capabilities, creating a recipe for negative results. That may be what happened to Miranda. He lost his selectivity at the plate, and began to try to hit every pitch out of the park. Miranda lost his confidence, and ultimately his role on the club.  The Tampa Bay Rays signed Miranda as a free agent and have invited him to Spring Training. He is not on the team's 40-man roster. In short, it is an opportunity for Miranda to open eyes and regain momentum. He is with a club that needs help at first base, and will also be showcasing for other clubs that may need depth at the position. It's a chance. An opportunity.  Spring Training will offer numerous players the chance for a fresh start with a new team. Brackman, Bianchi and Miranda are three among many hoping to show life in their bat or strength in their arm to gain a place on a Major League roster.
