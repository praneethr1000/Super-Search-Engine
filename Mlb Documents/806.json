    "body": "TORONTO -- Alex Anthopoulos appears to have found a new landing spot after a report surfaced Tuesday afternoon that the former Blue Jays general manager has accepted a front-office position with the Dodgers. The news was first reported by Vince Cauchon of Radio X et Rock in Quebec;Â the Dodgers have not confirmed the report. The exact nature of Anthopoulos' new position was not immediately clear, but the native of Montreal previously stated that he was exploring several opportunities and hoped to land a new job in the New Year. Anthopoulos was the architect of the 2015 American League East champions, but he declined to sign a new contract at the end of the season after citing it was no longer \"the right fit.\" Toronto president Mark Shapiro then went through a lengthy search for a new GM and ultimately hired Ross Atkins away from Cleveland. The reported move would see Anthopoulos go from one division winner to another. The Dodgers won the National League West in 2015, and they have an experienced front office that includes president of baseball operations Andrew Friedman, general manager Farhan Zaidi and former GM Ned Colletti.
