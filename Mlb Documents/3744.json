    "body": "ANAHEIM -- The Angels agreed to a one-year contract with infielder Alberto Callaspo on Monday, thereby avoiding arbitration.  The deal is worth $3.15 million, according to a source, which is slightly higher than the reported figure Kendrys Morales agreed to -- $2.975 million -- and right around what Callaspo was projected to garner via arbitration.  Callaspo, two seasons away from free agency, hit .288 with a .366 on-base percentage, six home runs and 46 RBIs while playing mostly third base in his first full season with the Angels in 2011. The 28-year-old, who finished up a 13-game stint in the Venezuelan Winter League just before the New Year, was originally signed by the Angels in 2001 and was dealt twice before circling back to them in a July 2010 exchange with the Royals   Callaspo is a career .281 hitter with a .337 on-base percentage in six seasons. He's mostly played third base in the big leagues, but has also seen time at second, shortstop and the outfield corners.   Along with Callaspo and Morales, the Angels had previously agreed with two other arbitration-eligible players, signing right-hander Jerome Williams to an $820,000 contract in December and giving second baseman Howie Kendrick a four-year, $33.5 million extension earlier in January.   The only arbitration-eligible player remaining is shortstop Erick Aybar, who's eligible for free agency after this season and with whom general manager Jerry Dipoto previously said he is open to negotiating an extension.
