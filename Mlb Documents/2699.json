    "body": "ANAHEIM -- The Angels avoided arbitration with third baseman David Freese on Wednesday, agreeing on a $6.425 million salary that stood as the midpoint of the numbers previously exchanged by both sides. The Angels' only remaining arbitration-eligible players are outfielder Matt Joyce, a pending free agent, and starting pitcher Garrett Richards, who attained Super Two status this offseason. Freese, also a free agent at season's end, batted .260 in his first season with the Angels, adding 10 homers, 55 RBIs and an adjusted OPS of 103 despite getting off to a slow start. Over a 99-game stretch in the last four months of the season, the 31-year-old batted .281\/.343\/.425. Alden Gonzalez is a reporter for MLB.com.
