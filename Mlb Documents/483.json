    "body": "CLEVELAND -- Arthur Rhodes' physical will determine whether or not the Coco Crisp-to-Boston deal finalizes or fizzles. Rhodes was in Philadelphia on Friday afternoon taking a physical that would complete a trade sending the 36-year-old reliever from the Indians to the Phillies in exchange for outfielder Jason Michaels, according to a source familiar with the negotiations. Once that deal goes through, the source said, the Indians and Red Sox would agree to a trade sending Crisp to the Red Sox. That trade could need the approval of the Commissioner's office depending on the amount of the potential cash transaction.           Michaels, who hit .304 with four homers and 31 RBIs, would likely take over Crisp's spot in left at Jacobs Field. He platooned with Kenny Lofton in center field for the Phillies last year.
