    "body": "ANAHEIM -- The Angels signed right-hander Robert Coello to a Minor League contract with an invitation to big league Spring Training on Monday.  Coello, 28, appeared in six games in 2010 for the Red Sox and six for the Blue Jays in '12, giving up 12 earned runs in 12 innings. With the Angels, he'll probably be a swing man in Triple-A.  In his six-year Minor League career, which began with a stint for the Angels' Arizona League team in 2007, Coello has compiled a 3.33 ERA in 171 games (31 starts), posting a rate of 9.9 strikeouts per nine innings, 3.9 walks per nine innings and a 1.23 WHIP.
