    "body": "They're always right at the center of it all -- covering all kinds of ground, joining up on rally killers, turning two when one isn't enough. Baseball's double-play combinations have remained busybodies this offseason.  With change and uncertainty surrounding several top duos throughout the winter, the middle infield will be a focus when teams hit the fields in Arizona and Florida for Spring Training next month.  Consider: It was confirmed only recently that a two-time pennant-winning combo confirmed will stay together heading into camp. Ian Kinsler will stay at second base, alongside Elvis Andrus, for the Rangers, rather than moving to first base. That leaves top prospect Jurickson Profar, the Rangers' future in the middle infield, without a spot -- for now. John Schlegel is a national reporter for MLB.com.
