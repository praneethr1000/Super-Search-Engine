    "body": "The Tigers and shortstop Jose Iglesias have agreed to a one-year, $1.65 million contract on Wednesday following the completion of the original four-year deal he signed with the Red Sox. Iglesias is not arbitration-eligible, but his salary needed to be determined following the completion of his $8.25 million contract previously signed with Boston. Iglesias will not be arbitration-eligible until the 2015-16 offseason, and he is under team control through the 2018 season. Iglesias, 23, finished second in the American League Rookie of the Year Award voting this season after hitting .303 between the Red Sox and Tigers. He was dealt midseason when Detroit was in need of a contingency plan to replace the suspended Jhonny Peralta. The sure-handed Iglesias is expected to be the Tigers' shortstop for the foreseeable future. Joey Nowak is a reporter for MLB.com. Follow him on Twitter at @joeynowak.
