    "body": "ARLINGTON -- Rangers president Nolan Ryan confirmed the club's interest in free-agent slugger Lance Berkman on Friday.  \"We've talked to him,\" Ryan said. \"We're waiting to hear back from him to see what his level of interest is and if he is going to play again next year.\"  The Rangers like Berkman because he is a proven switch-hitting power hitter who could fill a need at designated hitter and in the middle of their order. He can also play first base and one of the corner outfield spots, but would most likely get the majority of his at-bats at DH. The Rangers have been looking for a DH after trading Michael Young to the Phillies and losing out on Josh Hamilton. T.R. Sullivan is a reporter for MLB.com.
