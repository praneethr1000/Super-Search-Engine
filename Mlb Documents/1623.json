    "body": "MILWAUKEE -- Brewers general manager Doug Melvin said he was still in talks with \"a couple\" of infielders and hinted that shortstop Alex Gonzalez remained a possibility to return.  The Brewers are committed to young shortstop Jean Segura, who turns 23 in March, as their starter. At the moment, Jeff Bianchi is the top backup option on the 40-man roster, and the Brewers also signed former American League rookie of the year Bobby Crosby to a Minor League deal with a big league camp invite.  Gonzalez would provide more certainty. He was impressive in 24 games for the Brewers last season before suffering a season-ending knee injury that required surgery. Gonzalez will be 36 next month. \"We've talked to his guy. I'd rather not say where [it stands] at this point, with teams competing for certain guys.\"   Brewers manager Ron Roenicke said the team was also eyeing options at first base, where Corey Hart will miss the first two months after undergoing knee surgery last week. Mat Gamel is expected to start in Hart's absence, and the Brewers will give a good, long look in Spring Training to prospect Hunter Morris. Taylor Green could also play there.   \"There's still the possibility that Doug is talking to some guys right now [and] we get somebody else into camp,\" Roenicke said.   One option is a familiar one. FoxSports.com's Ken Rosenthal reported Monday that the Brewers have talked to Lyle Overbay about a Minor League deal with a big league camp invitation. Overbay was Milwaukee's regular first baseman in 2004 and 2005 before Melvin traded him to Toronto, freeing a spot for then-prospect Prince Fielder.",
