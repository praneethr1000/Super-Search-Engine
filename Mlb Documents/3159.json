    "body": "OAKLAND -- The A's parted with a piece of their outfield depth on Tuesday, trading Jai Miller to the Orioles for cash considerations.  Miller was designated for assignment on Dec. 23 following the Gio Gonzalez trade, which represented something of a surprising move by the A's, who held the outfielder in high regard and continually mentioned him in talk of the 2012 season.  Miller spent most of last year with Triple-A Sacramento, where he hit .276 with 32 home runs and 88 RBIs in 110 games. He appeared in just seven games as a September callup with the A's, going 3-for-12 with a home run and two RBIs, making a strong impression in little time. The 26-year-old is now headed for his fourth home -- he also spent time with the Marlins and Royals before his tenure in Oakland.  Jane Lee is a reporter for MLB.com.
