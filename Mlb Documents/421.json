    "body": "HOUSTON -- Jeff Bagwell was examined by Dr. James Andrews as scheduled on Thursday in Birmingham, Ala., but general manager Tim Purpura expects any definitive analysis regarding the examination to arrive no earlier than Friday, but more likely next week or later.  \"He went through the lab, he had X-rays, he met with Dr. Andrews,\" Purpura said. \"There's no further information.\" Bagwell visited the noted orthopedic surgeon at the request of the Astros, whose intention was to seek an outside analysis regarding the first baseman's right shoulder. Bagwell has been intensely rehabbing the shoulder on his own this offseason, but the Astros wanted a medical gauge of his progress, something they haven't received yet this winter. Purpura said earlier this week that he didn't expect the meeting with Andrews to give any sweeping revelations regarding Bagwell's status for 2006.   Bagwell's trip to Birmingham came one day after published reports indicated Houston had asked Bagwell to deem himself unable to play, therefore allowing the Astros to collect on the insurance policy they took out when Bagwell signed his contract extension in 2000. Purpura and Bagwell's agent, Barry Axelrod, refuted wire headlines that suggested the Astros had asked Bagwell to retire. Alyson Footer is a reporter for MLB.com.
