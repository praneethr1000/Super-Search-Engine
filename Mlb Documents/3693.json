    "body": "HOUSTON -- Astros general manager Jeff Luhnow said Tuesday he has assembled most of his key front-office personnel in anticipation of the 2012 season.  Luhnow has reworked the baseball operations department since he was hired in December, including the hiring of Sig Mejdal from the Cardinals to become the Astros' director of decisions sciences. Houston has also hired a new amateur scouting coordinator, as well as adding several new positions to the front office.  \"We're done with the major positions,\" Luhnow said. \"We are still looking at hiring some resources, Sig to fill out his group and help him. ... Other than that, we feel we have a pretty good group in place going forward into next year for the major functional areas.\" Charlie Norton, who had been with the organization for 10 years, has been let go by the club. He was named director of baseball research\/pro scouting coordinator two years ago and had served in a variety of roles, including assistant director of baseball operations (2005-07).   Last week, Luhnow hired Dan Radison (special assistant to the general manager\/player development), Mike Elias (special assistant to the general manager\/scouting) and Matt Sinatro (Major League catching and advance scouting coordinator).   Stephanie Wilka, who was hired as coordinator of amateur scouting, took the job previously occupied by Mike Burns, who left to become a scout with the Blue Jays.
