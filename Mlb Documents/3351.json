    "body": "The Mariners signed free-agent outfielder Brad Wilkerson to a one-year, $3 million contract Thursday, a signing that could be a signal that Seattle is close to completing the much-anticipated trade for left-handed pitcher Erik Bedard.  The Mariners would send outfielder Adam Jones, relief pitcher George Sherrill, and three Minor League pitchers to the Orioles for Bedard, giving Seattle a powerful one-two punch with Bedard and right-hander Felix Hernandez at the top of its rotation.  The Bedard deal has been on hold for several days, gone through numerous twists and turns, but is expected to be finalized -- one way or another -- within the next few days. Wilkerson, 30, spent the past two seasons with the Rangers, posting his third career 20-homer season in 2007 and driving in 62 runs. He batted .234 and started games in left field, right field, first base and designated hitter.         Jim Street is a reporter for MLB.com.
