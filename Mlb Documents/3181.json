    "body": "MILWAUKEE -- Two down, six arbitration-eligible players to go for the Brewers, who have reached terms with center fielder Carlos Gomez on a one-year contract.  FoxSports.com's Jon Paul Morosi first reported the agreement and said Gomez would earn \"around $2 million.\" That's a raise from his $1.5 million salary last season, when Gomez lost much of the second half to a broken collarbone but was otherwise part of a productive center-field platoon with Nyjer Morgan.  Morgan is among the six Brewers still eligible for arbitration, thus under club control for 2012 at a salary to be determined. The key player on that list is setup man Francisco Rodriguez, a free agent who accepted arbitration last month and will warrant a salary in the neighborhood of the $13.5 million he drew from the Mets and Brewers last season. General manager Doug Melvin is handling those negotiations with agent Scott Boras himself. Adam McCalvy is a reporter for MLB.com. Read his blog, Brew Beat, and follow him on Twitter at @AdamMcCalvy.
