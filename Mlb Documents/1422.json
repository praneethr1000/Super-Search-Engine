    "body": "ARLINGTON -- Rangers infielder Ian Kinsler plans to report to Spring Training on Feb. 10 and will bring a second baseman's glove him. He has no plans to purchase a first baseman's glove or even work at the position during the spring.  The Rangers, after some deliberation, are leaving Kinsler at second base, and that's the way he wants it.  \"I'm excited about it,\" Kinsler said before his scheduled autograph session at FanFest on Saturday. \"Second base is where I'm most comfortable, and it's a good feeling to have.\" T.R.
