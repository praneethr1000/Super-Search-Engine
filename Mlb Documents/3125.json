    "body": "PHILADELPHIA -- The Phillies aren't expected to have many job openings in Spring Training, but they will have plenty of people to choose from. They recently invited right-handers Austin Hyatt and B.J. Rosenberg to camp as non-roster invitees. Hyatt went 12-6 with a 3.85 ERA in 28 starts last season with Double-A Reading. Rosenberg went 5-7 with a 4.28 ERA in 39 appearances (14 starts) with Reading. They join 13 other non-roster invitees: right-handers Dave Bush, Scott Elarton and Brian Sanches; left-handers David Purcey, Pat Misch and Raul Valdes; catchers Steven Lerud and Tuffy Gosewisch; infielders Pete Orr, Kevin Frandsen and Hector Luna; and outfielders Scott Podsednik and Luis Montanez.  Entering Spring Training, the Phillies might have two jobs available, if everybody is healthy. (And typically not everybody is healthy.) They could be looking for a fifth outfielder, if Philadelphia decides to carry 11 pitchers. Podsednik could be the strongest candidate, unless the Phils bring in another outfielder before camp opens in February.  They also could be looking for another bullpen arm if somebody like Jose Contreras isn't healthy. He is recovering from offseason right elbow surgery. Sanches could be the strongest candidate of the non-roster invitees. Todd Zolecki is a reporter for MLB.com. This story was not subject to the approval of Major League Baseball or its clubs.",
