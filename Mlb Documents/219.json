    "body": "The regular seasons in the four Winter Leagues have all come to an end. Playoffs are under way to determine who will be the representatives in this year's Caribbean Series, to be held in Valencia and Maracay, Venezuela, from Feb. 2-7. During the regular season, teams are generally led by prospects trying to climb the ladder, some veteran journeymen and a few younger established Major Leaguers trying to stay sharp during the offseason in front of fans in their native countries. Winter ball offers an interesting mix of developmental experience for young players in a win-at-all-costs atmosphere. Once the leagues reach the playoffs, however, top-notch Major League talent is added to rosters to try to make a big push to the Series. People unfamiliar with baseball in the four countries that host Winter League baseball -- the Dominican Republic, Mexico, Puerto Rico and Venezuela -- will get a glimpse of what national pride is all about in the World Baseball Classic this March. But prior to the advent of that event, the Caribbean World Series has been as important a championship as any in the world, at least to those who hope to participate in it.  In 2005, the Mazatlan Venados not only won the Series title for their native Mexico, they did it in their own ballpark.  \"To win it in front of your fans, that was unbelievable,\" Mexican legend and new Padres third baseman Vinny Castilla said. \"It ranks right at the top. When you play for your country, it means a lot to me.\"  This year, it will be Venezuela's turn to try to win one on its own turf. Like with Castilla, who joined Mazatlan late in the season, Venezuelans like Victor Zambrano, Ramon Hernandez (who played in last year's Caribbean Series), Edgardo Alfonzo and Miguel Cabrera have joined playoff clubs late with the hope of bringing home glory in 2006.     Perhaps the biggest name, and the one most eager to play in the Caribbean Series, is Miguel Tejada. Tejada has played winter ball for more than a decade, and this year, he's joined Aguilas Cibaenas for the semifinals in the Dominican. Unless he begs off, it's almost a guarantee he'll play for whatever club represents his country in the Caribbean Series next month.  \"This is important for me,\" Tejada said at last year's Series. \"I want to play in every country. This is important to me because when I retire, that's the thing I'm going to remember.  \"At the same time, I like to represent my country because my country is a baseball country. Everywhere we go, we have to take a good team because that's what we do over there. We play baseball.\" Jonathan Mayo is a reporter for MLB.com.
