    "body": "MILWAUKEE -- The Brewers signed left-hander Pat Misch to a Minor League contract on Friday that includes an invitation to big league camp, offering the veteran another opportunity to pitch his way back to the Major Leagues. Misch, 34, made 78 appearances for the Giants and Mets from 2006-11 with a 4.80 ERA. Since then, he has pitched at the Triple-A level for the Phillies, Tigers and Marlins without getting a call back to the big leagues. He has undergone and recovered from Tommy John surgery, pitched in the independent Atlantic League, as well as Puerto Rico and Taiwan. It was in Taiwan, after the Marlins released Misch last July, that he experienced the signature moment of his career. In November, after starting Game 4 and appearing in relief during Game 6 of the Taiwan championship series, Misch threw a clinching no-hitter in Game 7, with one fifth-inning walk representing the only damage against him.

Absolutely, it was the best game I've ever pitched.\" Misch told Baseball America that he hoped his strong finish would lead him back to a big league camp. The Brewers, with only one left-hander on the 40-man roster (Will Smith) and one other left-handed non-roster invitee (Nick Hagadone) proved the right fit. \"Of course I would love to be back in the Major Leagues,\" Misch said. \"I can do it.\" Misch is the Brewers' 11th non-roster invitee to Spring Training, and the fourth pitcher. The others are Hagadone and right-handers Hiram Burgos and Daniel Tillman. Adam McCalvy is a reporter for MLB.com. Follow him on Twitter @AdamMcCalvy, like him on Facebook and listen to his podcast.
