    "body": "Maybe it was as simple as John Henry looking up one day from his art catalogue and calling out to the guy behind the other desk, \"Hey, Theo, with all the time you spend here, might as well get back to work. Or start paying rent.\"  Or perhaps it was the lure of those Krispy Kreme spreads in the employees lounge. Or, both Theo Epstein and Larry Lucchino, that Odd Couple, getting tired after 10 weeks of a staredown without either blinking.  Whatever and however, there's certainly something in those baked beans that make it hard for people with Boston in their blood to walk away.
