    "body": "SAN FRANCISCO -- The Giants trimmed their Major League roster to its 40-man limit Thursday by designating infielder-outfielder Chris Dominguez for assignment. The 6-foot-4, 233-pound Dominguez made his Major League debut last September after spending most of six professional seasons in the Minors. He mustered one hit in 17 at-bats, a home run at San Diego on Sept. 21. Dominguez owns a .269 career batting average with 91 homers in 689 games as a Minor Leaguer. Dominguez, 28, was the Giants' third-round selection in the 2009 First-Year Player Draft. Chris Haft is a reporter for MLB.com.
