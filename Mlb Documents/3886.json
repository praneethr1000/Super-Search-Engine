Backe, 29, is expected to fill a rotation spot after missing most of the 2007 season while recovering from Tommy John elbow ligament replacement surgery. He made five starts last September, compiling a 3-1 record and a 3.77 ERA. Backe won his final three starts.  The right-hander owns a career record of 22-15 with a 4.63 ERA over 109 games (47 starts). Alyson Footer is a reporter for MLB.com.
