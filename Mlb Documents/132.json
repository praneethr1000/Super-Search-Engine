    "body": "PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Utilityman Mike Edwards is the latest former Los Angeles Dodgers player to sign with the Pittsburgh Pirates, agreeing to a Minor League contract Sunday. Edwards hit .247 with three homers and 15 RBIs in 88 games last season for Los Angeles, playing third base and the outfield. After the season ended, manager Jim Tracy left the Dodgers and was hired as the Pirates manager. The Pirates added former Dodgers reliever Giovanni Carrara last week, also signing him to a Minor League contract. Right-handed reliever Terry Adams, another former Dodgers pitcher, signed with Pittsburgh in November. Also signing Minor League contracts with the Pirates were infielder Gookie Dawkins, a former Reds prospect who hasn't played in the Majors since being with the Royals in 2003, and Paul Chiaffredo, the backup catcher at the Pirates' Triple-A Indianapolis farm club last season.",
