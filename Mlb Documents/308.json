    "body": "DENVER -- Colorado right-handed pitcher Zach Day agreed to a one-year, $600,000 contract with incentives on Tuesday to avoid arbitration. Now he hopes he can avoid line drives.  Last May 23, Day was pitching for Washington when a line drive by Ken Griffey Jr. caused a hairline fracture in his wrist. The Rockies acquired him on July 13 and gave him some time in Triple-A to complete his recovery and regain his form. But on Sept. 16, Day suffered a season-ending thumb fracture when hit by another liner, by Arizona's Craig Counsell.  \"I don't know how many guys can say they had two injuries with line drives in one year, and that's not the way you want to go down in the record books, for sure,\" said Day, who also had his 2004 season end early because of a broken finger suffered during a bunt attempt. \"It's a year I want to put in the past. I celebrated New Year's pretty well. I was looking forward to '06 flipping over.\" Day, 27, went a combined 1-3 with a 6.85 ERA in 17 games, including eight starts, for Colorado and Washington. But in the new year, he will compete with righty Sunny Kim for the fifth spot. Day can earn an addition $25,000 with 140 innings pitched, and $25,000 beyond that with 150 innings pitched.   \"The amount of physical work he's done is tremendous,\" Rockies general manager Dan O'Dowd said. \"He looks great. We really feel he's going to bounce back and be very good this year. He's going to get his innings and give us some wins this year. He's healthy and in a great frame of mind.\"   O'Dowd is counting on Day to return to his pre-2005 form, when he was an effective sinkerballer with the Montreal Expos. Day pitched well in 2004, posting a 3.93 ERA even though he had the worst per-game run support in the Majors (2.47) and therefore finished 5-10.   Day began throwing in November and reported no problems, and he believes his time in Colorado Springs with then-Triple-A pitching coach Bob McClure (now with the Kansas City Royals) helped him learn.   \"I've looked at videotape and I've become a big advocate of watching other successful pitchers -- Bob McClure got me stated with that,\" Day said. \"I did that when I was healthy at the end of last year, and I've carried that over to my offseason workouts. Everything is feeling fine.\"   Day signed before arbitration-eligible players and their teams exchanged figures on Tuesday. Last week, the Rockies avoided arbitration with right-hander Aaron Cook by agreeing to a two-year, $4.5 million guarantee.   Remaining arbitration-eligible players are Kim, who requested $800,000 while the team offered $600,000, and catcher Yorvitt Torrealba requested $1.05 million while the team offered $815,000. If the club cannot sign Kim or Torrealba, their 2006 salaries -- either the player's figure or the club's -- will be set by an arbitration panel at a hearing during which both sides present their cases. Such hearings would take place in February.   Odds and ends: O'Dowd said the Rockies continue to look for \"a veteran utilityman who plays a number of positions, shortstop being one of them,\" but he added that young players Omar Quintanilla or Josh Wilson could fill that role if the right guy cannot be found. O'Dowd also said the Rockies are not necessarily looking for a sixth competitor for the rotation, but would like someone who could start or pitch out of the bullpen.     Medical mini-camp: This week the Rockies have begun workouts at Coors Field with nine prospects that either saw their 2005 seasons shortened by injuries, underwent postseason procedures or have injury concerns. The work they're doing gives the Rockies a chance to see their progress and oversee their rehab, and at the same time allows them to get accustomed to Coors Field and to working with the Rockies' staff.   The players are:   2003 No. 1 draft pick Ian Stewart, a third baseman who recently had a cyst removed from his wrist;    2005 No. 1 pick Tory Tulowitzki, a shortstop who battled a groin problem in his first pro season;   Matt Macri, an infielder who suffered a fractured wrist and also needed cartilage repair in that area;    Seth Smith, an outfielder who batted .300 at Class A Modesto and recently had Lasik eye surgery;   Chris Iannetta, a catcher who played at Modesto and Double-A Tulsa last year but also dealt with a wrist fracture;   2005 fifth-round pick Josh Sullivan, a right-handed pitcher who is recovering from labrum surgery;   Shane Lindsey, a right-hander who was chosen MiLB.com's Short-Season Starting Pitcher of the Year but has been dealing with labrum issues;   Darren Clarke, a right-handed relief prospect whose 2005 was cut short by shoulder problems;   2005 seventh-round pick Geoff Strickland, a shortstop who was limited to designated hitter duty because of an elbow injury.
