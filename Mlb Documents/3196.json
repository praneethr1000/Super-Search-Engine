    "body": "ST. LOUIS -- Matt Holliday said Sunday that he has no reservations or concerns about the health of his right wrist, 2 1\/2 months after suffering an injury that forced him to miss Game 7 of the World Series. Holliday got hurt during Game 6 of the World Series, rolling his wrist when he slid into third base to avoid a pickoff attempt in the sixth inning. He was removed from the roster for Game 7 in favor of Adron Chambers, a move that had to be approved by the Commissioner's Office. Asked Sunday about the condition of his wrist, Holliday simply said, \"100 percent.\" He was speaking at the annual Cardinals Care Winter Warm-Up fan festival. Holliday said in October that if he had suffered the injury during the regular season, it would have required him to go on the 15-day disabled list.",
