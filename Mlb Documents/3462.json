    "body": "CINCINNATI -- Going into this offseason, there were few indications that the Reds and free-agent closer Ryan Madson would be a match. The club has been watching its budget closely for years and Madson was seeking a large multiyear deal.  Yet on Friday, Madson was officially signed and sealed as the new closer in Cincinnati. After Madson passed a physical, the two sides finalized a one-year contract that will pay the right-hander $6 million in 2012. There is an $11 million mutual option for 2013 that carries a $2.5 million buyout. Some of the money in the deal will be deferred.  \"It was an interesting offseason, as everybody knows,\" Madson said on a media conference call. \"The opportunity came late. It was for the role I wanted, to close, which were few and far between at that time. To get the opportunity to close and close for a team that has a really good chance to be in the playoffs, that's where you want to be as a player.\" Mark Sheldon is a reporter for MLB.com.
