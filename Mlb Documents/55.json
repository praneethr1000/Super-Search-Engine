    "body": "NEW YORK -- Bruce Sutter will enter the National Baseball Hall of Fame on July 30 with the interlocking S, T and L of the St. Louis Cardinals on his cap, an official of the shrine in Cooperstown, N.Y., said on Wednesday.  Sutter made history on Tuesday when he became the first pure reliever elected among the 196 players in the Hall, 103 by members of the Baseball Writers Association of America, who voted him in as this year's only inductee.  Sutter becomes the eighth member of the Cardinals and first since Ozzie Smith in 2002 to go into the Hall representing the Redbirds. Smith also was the lone inductee at the time. The others are Lou Brock, Dizzy Dean, Bob Gibson, Stan Musial, Red Schoendienst and Enos Slaughter. The Cardinals list 37 players, 14 of them pitchers, who played at least a portion of their careers in St. Louis and are enshrined in the Hall. No matter, it wasn't his choice. And on Wednesday, Sutter appeared at a press conference in Manhattan and was asked to don a dark blue cap with a Hall of Fame insignia above the brim and a white jersey with Hall of Fame embossed in script across the chest. A photo placard of Sutter to the right of the dais showed the bearded right-hander throwing off the mound in Cardinals garb juxtaposed to a black and white photo of a young clean-shaven Sutter wearing his Cubs uniform.
