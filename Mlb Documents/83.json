    "body": "The Seattle Mariners took care of another important piece of bullpen business Thursday, avoiding arbitration with reliever Julio Mateo by agreeing to a two-year contract with the right-hander worth a reported $1.875 million.  Mateo, 28, was 3-6 with a 3.06 ERA and 52 strikeouts in 88 1\/3 innings over the course of a career-high 55 games. According to The Associated Press, Seattle holds a $1.5 million option for 2008 with a $100,000 buyout.  \"Julio has been one of our most consistent relievers,\" Mariners general manager Bill Bavasi said in a statement prepared by the club. \"He's durable, dependable, willing to pitch in any role and successful. That's a great combination of attributes for a relief pitcher.\" Mateo was third in the American League in innings pitched by a reliever last year and held opponents to a .237 batting average, including a .209 average by left-handed hitters.   Starter Gil Meche and infielder Willie Bloomquist remain eligible for arbitration.   Meanwhile, the Mariners officially added outfielder Matt Lawton to their 40-man roster, making room for Lawton by designating right-handed reliever Scott Atchison for assignment.   Seattle now has 10 days to trade, release or outright Atchison to the Minor Leagues.   Atchison spent most of last season on the disabled list with a strained right elbow.
