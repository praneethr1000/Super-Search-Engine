    "body": "DENVER -- Rockies top prospect Nolan Arenado turned 21 at the start of last season at Double-A Tulsa. It turned out he was old enough, all right ... old enough to experience stress in a baseball uniform for the first time. But as often is the case, the rough early days of true adulthood have given Arenado wisdom. Arenado, a power-hitting third baseman and the Rockies' second-round pick in the 2009 First-Year Player Draft, recovered from a rough midseason patch to finish strong for a Tulsa team that made the Texas League playoffs. Heading into his second Major League Spring Training, Arenado reports being in better shape physically, and believes he is better able to put aside the pressures that come with climbing to the big leagues.
