    "body": "NEW YORK -- Alex Rodriguez may wind up playing in the World Baseball Classic after all, though he had not made any official decision as of Wednesday.  Despite a report in the New York Times, which said that A-Rod is \"expected to announce this week that he has changed his mind and will play for the United States team,\" a source with knowledge of the situation said that the reigning American League MVP has not committed to participating in the event.  Rodriguez has been on vacation with his family since the holidays, and isn't expected to make any announcement until next week, assuming he does in fact change his mind. Buck Martinez, the manager of Team USA, said he has had no direct contact with Rodriguez and he he has not been informed officially of any change in his status.   \"I've heard the same thing everybody else is hearing, but nothing firm,\" Martinez said. \"I think this is a tougher decision for him than anyone really imagines.\"   Sixty-man rosters for each of the 16 teams must be submitted on Jan. 17. At that point, drug testing under international rules begins and any player not already submitted at that point can't participate in the tournament.   Rodriguez was named as one of 177 Major League players committed to the event during the Winter Meetings, though he was one of the few that was not attached to a country. When the event was first announced back at the All-Star Game in July, Rodriguez said that he would look for guidance from Major League Baseball and the Players Association.   In December, he said in a radio interview that he was leaning toward playing for the Dominican Republic, but told the New York Post just days later that he would skip the event altogether.   \"After thoughtful deliberations with my family, I am announcing my decision to withdraw from the World Baseball Classic,\" Rodriguez told the paper. \"When faced with the decision to choose between my country, the United States of America, and my Dominican heritage, I decided I will not dishonor either.\"   \"I am proud to be an American citizen and to have a Dominican legacy,\" A-Rod told the paper. \"My commitment to baseball is secondary to honoring my patriotic duties to my country and my ancestors.\"   Gene Orza, chief operating officer of the MLBPA, said at the time that he hoped Rodriguez would change his mind.   \"Alex has, and I'm sure continues, to agonize over this decision,\" Orza said in a December e-mail to the Associated Press. \"I would not regard his statement [Friday] as the final or definitive word. Alex is also devoted to the growth of baseball internationally, and is a fan of baseball in the Olympics. He realizes that the WBC serves both of those interests. We haven't spoken yet. We will. And having known and respected him since he was drafted, my suspicion is that, in the end, fans around the world will see Alex in a WBC uniform.\"   The only Yankees currently planning to play in the WBC are Derek Jeter and Johnny Damon of the United States, Robinson Cano of the Dominican Republic and Bernie Williams of Puerto Rico.
