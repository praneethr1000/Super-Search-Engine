On Wednesday, the team announced its itinerary for the 2008 Reds Winter Caravan, which will run Jan. 24-27 in partnership with CincinnatiUSA.com. The plans are ambitious -- 28 stops in 25 cities and towns covering four states in four days for a total of more than 1,500 miles.  There will be two separate caravans touring simultaneously. The trips kick off Thursday, Jan. 24, and will include 12 fan stops that will be free and open to the public and 13 Hot Stove stops at Reds radio affiliates. Mark Sheldon is a reporter for MLB.com.
