    "body": "ARLINGTON -- The Rangers offered little comment on a report out of Miami that stated outfielder Nelson Cruz was among a list of prominent clients at a clinic under investigation for the sale of performance-enhancing drugs.  The report by the Miami New Times said that Cruz bought $4,000 worth of products from Anthony Bosch, the head of an anti-aging clinic near the University of Miami. The report said Cruz bought the medicine in 2012.  \"The Texas Rangers were contacted late last week by Miami New Times regarding the story posted this morning,\" the Rangers said in a statement on Tuesday morning. \"At that time, the Rangers contacted Major League Baseball on that inquiry. The team has no further comment.\" T.R. Sullivan is a reporter for MLB.com. Read his blog, Postcards from Elysian Fields, and follow him on Twitter @Sullivan_Ranger.
