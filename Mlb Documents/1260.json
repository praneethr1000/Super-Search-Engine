    "body": "MINNEAPOLIS -- The Twins agreed to terms with left-hander Brian Duensing on a one-year deal worth $1.3 million to avoid arbitration on Friday. The agency that represents Duensing, CAA Sports, was the first to announce the deal via Twitter. The Twins were able to sign all of their arbitration-eligible players before Friday's noon CT deadline to exchange filing numbers, as they also signed catcher Drew Butera to a one-year deal worth $700,000 on Wednesday. Right-hander Jared Burton avoided arbitration back in December, when he signed a two-year extension that includes an option for '15. Duensing, who was arbitration-eligible for the first time in his career, posted a 5.12 ERA with 69 strikeouts and 27 walks in 109 innings last season. The 29-year-old fared better in relief with a 3.47 ERA in 57 innings out of the bullpen compared to a 6.92 ERA in 52 frames as a starter. In parts of four seasons, Duensing has a career 4.23 ERA in 164 appearances, including 61 starts. His best season came in 2010, when he had a 2.62 ERA in 130 2\/3 innings. He's expected to be the club's top left-handed setup reliever in '13, with fellow left-hander Glen Perkins serving as closer. Rhett Bollinger is a reporter for MLB.com.
