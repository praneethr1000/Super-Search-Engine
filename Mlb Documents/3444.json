    "body": "FORT WORTH -- Josh Hamilton or Prince Fielder? Hamilton knows that debate is ongoing, even while his agent, Mike Moye, is actively talking to the Rangers about a long-term extension.  Fielder is currently a free agent. Hamilton can be a free agent after this upcoming season and intends to go that route if the Rangers can't sign him to an extension before Spring Training begins. But there are some who suggest the Rangers should sign Fielder to a long-term deal and let Hamilton leave at the end of the season.  \"It comes down to what you want,\" Hamilton said on Monday night. \"I see people comparing us. Put him in center field and see how long he lasts. Put me at first and see how long I last. He's played 160 games in a season a lot. I haven't. There are pros and cons. It's pretty fun to watch.\" T.R. Sullivan is a reporter for MLB.com. Read his blog, Postcards from Elysian Fields, and follow him on Twitter @Sullivan_Ranger.
