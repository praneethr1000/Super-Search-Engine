    "body": "At least there's a reason not to vote for Jack Morris for the Hall of Fame. It's not a good reason, but at least it's a reason.  That's one more than the people refusing to vote for Jeff Bagwell have. Are you ready for some silliness?  First, here's to Barry Larkin, a great player and consummate professional, for being voted into the Hall of Fame. He played like a Hall of Famer, carried himself like a Hall of Famer and did the game he loved proud. There's a case to be made for several players on this year's ballot. Let's consider the case of two obvious ones.     First, Bagwell. In his second year on the ballot, he received 56 percent of the vote, up from 41.7 in his first appearance. The problem is not so much with his low vote total as the reason for it. His credentials say he should be in.   Bagwell's career .948 OPS is higher than that of Frank Robinson, Hank Aaron and Willie Mays. He's 40th all-time in on-base percentage, 35th in home runs and 46th in RBIs.   He was also a terrific baserunner and defensive player and a solid clubhouse presence on teams that went to the playoffs six times in a nine-year stretch. He won the National League Most Valuable Player Award once and finished in the top 10 in the voting five other times. He made the NL All-Star team four times.   There's just one problem with his candidacy. Some voters believe he may have used steroids. Guess what? They're right. Every player on the ballot may have used steroids. There's no way of knowing.   From the moment performance-enhancing drugs enter a sport, there's going to be a endless cat-and-mouse game between those doing the testing and those being tested.   What are those of us who vote supposed to do? Well, we're either going to stop voting for anyone, or we're going to deal with facts. If more facts become available, we'll deal with those, too.   Bagwell has constantly maintained he did not use steroids or human growth hormone. He was never suspended for using performance-enhancing drugs or connected to an investigation into steroids.     Those are the facts as we know them. Still, some voters point out that he added slabs of muscle and hit a bunch of home runs. This, they say, can mean only one thing. (He played at a time when ballparks and strike zone got smaller, and bats and balls got harder. Yes, some players used steroids, but there was a lot going on besides steroids in the steroid era.)   How about we stick to what we know instead of what we think we know?   \"Are you telling me that anyone in my generation who did great things is going to be suspected of cheating?\" Bagwell once asked.   Yes, unfortunately that's the case.   I'm all in for not voting for the guys who have been connected to steroids. They've cheated the game and put peer pressure on others -- especially younger players -- to use them.   Who used and who didn't? That's the question that can't be answered. There's a chance we could make a mistake and put a steroid user in the Hall of Fame. In fact, that's almost guaranteed of happening. It may already have happened.   When a Hall of Famer is found to have used steroids, we can have that discussion. Performance-enhancing substances have changed so much in baseball already, so why can't the Hall of Fame adjust to them?   If a player is found to have used steroids after being inducted, we ought to be able to march right in there and remove his plaque. Now that would be a statement.   Otherwise, it's just going to be a guessing game, and it's absolutely unfair to a player like Bagwell, who is not known to have done anything wrong. It's a slippery slope. We'll never know who did and who didn't. Let's deal with what we know.   Now about Morris. Perhaps the good news from Monday's Hall of Fame announcement is that his wait appears to be almost over. He was named on a 66.7 percent of the 573 ballots cast and is now breathtakingly close.   He got just 19.6 percent of the vote in his second year on the ballot, and back then, it appeared there was no way he'd make up enough ground during 15 years of eligiblility. Later this year, he'll be on the ballot for the 14th time and may finally get the telephone call he deserves.   He finished his 18-year career with a 3.90 ERA, and that would be the highest for any pitcher inducted into the Hall of Fame. I've heard that argument dozens of times the last few days during the debate over his candidacy. Granted, that's an ugly number. It's also just one number. His career needs to be put in a larger context.   He was one of the game's great competitors, a fiery bulldog of a man who was at his best when the game meant the most. He played on three World Series winners and started Game 1 of the playoffs in six of seven series. He got the ball on Opening Day 14 years in a row.   Between 1979 and 1992, he averaged 17 victories and 241 innings a season. He was baseball's winningest pitcher in the 1980s. To those of us lucky enough to watch him pitch, to those of us who were there for some of his finest moments, there's no question he belongs in the Hall of Fame.   If the definition of a Hall of Famer is being one of the best pitchers of his generation, there's no question he belongs in.   He's like Bagwell in that way. Players who've gotten 50 percent of the vote typically have gotten in at some point, and hopefully that'll be the case for Bagwell and Morris.   They both defined greatness and winning. They both are the living definitions of what we'd like the best of the best to be.   Both should feel optimistic at this point, and maybe we'll be throwing a big party for them at this time next year. They both deserve it. Richard Justice is a columnist for MLB.com.
