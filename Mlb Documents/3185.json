    "body": "MIAMI -- In December, the Marlins made three major free-agent signings that helped reshape their roster. Over a five-day span, they brought in All-Stars Heath Bell, Jose Reyes and Mark Buehrle.  In the next couple of days, the organization's attention will be focused on signing four of their own.  Miami has four arbitration-eligible players who have yet to reach agreement on contracts for the 2012 season -- Emilio Bonifacio, Edward Mujica, Anibal Sanchez and Juan Carlos Oviedo (formerly Leo Nunez). The four were among the 142 players league-wide who filed for salary arbitration on Friday, as announced by the Major League Baseball Players Association.   The arbitration filing period ran from Jan. 5 until Friday, with Tuesday set as the day for salary arbitration figures to be exchanged. The players and teams that have hearings will engage in that process from Feb. 1-21 in St. Petersburg.   If agreements are not reached by Tuesday's deadline, per team policy, the Marlins will let the arbitration panel decide what the player will make at a hearing.   Bonifacio, who projects to be the starting center fielder, is arbitration-eligible for the first time.   Sanchez, who is part of the rotation, and Oviedo, who will move from closer to a setup role, are each in their final year of arbitration. Oviedo is currently on MLB's restricted list while he resolves issues related to his identity.   Mujica, a setup reliever, is in his second year of arbitration. Joe Frisaro is a reporter for MLB.com.
