    "body": "GRAND FORKS, N.D. -- This time last year, left-hander Glen Perkins knew that nothing was guaranteed for the 2011 season.  In 2010, Perkins posted a 5.82 ERA in 21 2\/3 innings with the Twins, and he didn't fare much better at Triple-A Rochester, with a 5.81 ERA in 124 innings.  But he went into Spring Training determined to make an impact, and he ended up having a career year, leading the team with a 2.48 ERA while striking out 65 batters in 61 2\/3 innings. So Perkins now has the comfort of knowing that he'll certainly make the club as the top setup man, but that doesn't mean he's resting on his laurels after an impressive season.   \"I think part of what made me successful last year was coming into Spring Training with the mentality that I was fighting for a job,\" Perkins said. \"This year I know I'm not competing for a spot, but I want to come into Spring Training ready to pitch in games. I don't want to use Spring Training to get into shape without being ready to pitch. I want to use it to get into middle of the season form.\"   Perkins has been working hard to get ready for the season. He started his throwing program on Dec. 5 and threw off a mound for the first time last week.   But this week he's taking it a bit easier, taking part in the Twins' annual Winter Caravan, which goes through northern Minnesota and North Dakota. He found time to play catch with fellow left-hander Brian Duensing on Wednesday at the University of North Dakota.   Perkins says that his plan is to throw six bullpen sessions before pitchers and catchers report to Fort Myers, Fla., on Feb. 18. But he added that his first go-round on the mound didn't exactly qualify as a bullpen session.   \"It was more of a tester, because I knew I was going on the Caravan and I wouldn't be able to do as much as I usually would,\" he said. \"I just wanted to get a gauge for where I'm at. But I felt great, and this week I backed off a little bit and prioritized other things.\"   Perkins' priorities this week include giving back to the community, as he's met with many fans to answer questions and sign autographs. It's a special event for Perkins, considering he's a native of Minnesota, having grown up about 30 miles from Minneapolis in Stillwater.   \"I think I have a special connection with the fans, because it was the same thing for me, because I grew up in Minnesota,\" said Perkins, who is participating in the Winter Caravan for a fifth time. \"You get into January and February, and you can't wait for Spring Training and the start of the season. I always followed the team in Spring Training and checked their record and the whole deal, so I know what it's like being a fan of this team. So it's special to see the passion the fans have.\"   Perkins also agreed to a contact for the 2012 season during the Caravan, coming to terms on a one-year deal worth $1.55 million on Tuesday after making $700,000 last year. He said it was a simple process, with his agent talking to the Twins on Friday and getting the deal done by Monday.   \"It's good,\" he said. \"The two years I've gone through arbitration, we've settled on that day where we have to exchange figures. The Twins and my agent get along real well. Even this year, even though I had a little more leverage with the season I had, we had no hiccups or anything like that.\"   So coming off a big season, and with a contract in hand, Perkins is looking forward to 2012. And with the additions of hurlers Jason Marquis and Joel Zumaya, he thinks the club will have a better pitching staff in 2012.   \"I think as much as anything, adding a guy like Marquis will help, because he can throw 200 innings and go deep into games every time out,\" Perkins said. \"That will help our bullpen out. Same with a guy like Carl Pavano. And then [Zumaya], if he can stay on the field and throw 100 mph from the right side, it will only help.\" Rhett Bollinger is a reporter for MLB.com.
