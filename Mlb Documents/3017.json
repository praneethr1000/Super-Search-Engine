    "body": "MILWAUKEE -- The Brewers ran outfielder Norichika Aoki through a workout on Sunday and a physical exam on Monday morning, but the club is still discussing whether to pursue signing the 30-year-old three-time Japanese league batting champion.  The sides have until 4 p.m. CT on Jan. 17 to strike a deal. If they do, Aoki would provide a left-handed bat off the bench and insurance against a possible suspension for left fielder Ryan Braun. If they do not strike a deal, then Aoki returns to the Tokyo Yakult Swallows for a sixth season and the Brewers are off the hook for his $2.5 million posting fee.  \"We worked him out, and then we had some discussions last night, and we'll have some more today about whether to go further,\" said general manager Doug Melvin, who attended the workout.
