    "body": "The Athletics agreed to terms on one-year contracts with right-handers Brandon McCarthy and Joey Devine on Tuesday, and with that they settled with all their arbitration-eligible players before sides were scheduled to exchange figures.  McCarthy's 2012 contract will be for $4.275 million, according to the San Francisco Chronicle. The 28-year-old, who's eligible for free agency after the '12 season, is coming off a career year in '11, one in which he went 9-9 with a 3.32 ERA and a 4.92 strikeout-to-walk ratio -- an A's club record -- in 25 starts.  McCarthy posted career highs in wins, starts, complete games (five), innings pitched (170 2\/3) and strikeouts (123) in 2011, while setting career lows in ERA, opponents' on-base percentage (.281) and slugging percentage (.377). McCarthy's 1.32 walks per nine innings was the second-lowest mark in A's history. Devine, two years away from free agency, returned to the Majors for the first time in three seasons last year after undergoing Tommy John surgery. The 28-year-old posted a 3.52 ERA and a 1.261 WHIP in 23 innings -- 26 appearances -- during a two-month stint with the A's last season. For Triple-A Sacramento, he went 4-0 with three saves and a 4.24 ERA in 23 appearances.   The A's had previously agreed to terms with Daric Barton ($1.1 million reported figure), Dallas Braden ($3.35 million), Landon Powell ($620,000) and Adam Rosales ($600,000).
