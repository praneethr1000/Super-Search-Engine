    "body": "HOUSTON -- The Astros finalized their coaching staff for the 2012 season by announcing on Tuesday that they had hired Craig Bjornson as bullpen coach.  Bjornson, a former pitcher in the Astros' Minor League system, has 13 years of experience in professional baseball as a pitching coach, most recently for the rookie-level Casper Ghosts of the Rockies organization (2009-11).  With Bjornson on board, the Astros' field staff will consist of manager Brad Mills, bench coach Joe Pettini, pitching coach Doug Brocail, third-base coach Dave Clark and first-base coach Bobby Meacham. Pettini is also new to the staff, having been hired last week after 10 years in the same position with the Cardinals. Bjornson will fill a role occupied for the last two years by Jamie Quirk, who left the Astros following last season to become bench coach for the Cubs. The Astros offered the bullpen coaching job to Al Pedrique, who had been the bench coach, but he chose to resign instead.   Bjornson, 42, has also worked as a pitching coach in the Dodgers, Nationals, Royals and Expos organizations and spent three seasons as pitching coach for the Occidente Pastora de los Llanos of the Venezuelan Winter League (2000-03).   Bjornson was signed by the Astros as a non-drafted free agent in 1991 after pitching at Nicholls State University in Louisiana. He pitched three seasons in the Astros' farm system from 1991-93, posting an overall mark of 9-18 with a 3.82 ERA in 81 appearances (27 starts) with a complete game and three saves. His pitching career included stints at Class A Asheville, Burlington and Quad Cities. Brian McTaggart is reporter for MLB.com and writes an MLBlog, Tag's Lines. Follow @brianmctaggart on Twitter.
