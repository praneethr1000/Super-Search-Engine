    "body": "The best and brightest products of Major League Baseball's Urban Youth Academy in Compton, Calif., will be on full display Saturday, when El Camino College plays host to an alumni game that will pit some of the program's best-known names against the current UYA Prep All-Stars.  The Compton branch of the Urban Youth Academy opened in 2006, and it already has two former players in the Major Leagues. Both of them -- Trayvon Robinson and Efren Navarro -- made their debut last season and will be playing for the alumni side in Saturday's game.  Robinson, a graduate of nearby Crenshaw High School, was originally drafted and developed by the Dodgers but was sent to Seattle last year in a three-way trade. Robinson, a 24-year-old outfielder, batted .210 with two home runs in his 44-game audition last year with the Mariners. Spencer Fordin is a reporter for MLB.com.
