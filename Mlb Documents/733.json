    "body": "PHOENIX -- On Dec. 3, when the D-backs unveiled their new uniforms, first baseman Paul Goldschmidt was asked about a recent revelation that the team had made a $120 million contract offer to free-agent pitcher Johnny Cueto. \"I said then that we always knew the front office had the commitment and were willing to spend the money if they thought it was worth it,\" Goldschmidt said on Friday. \"So that was not a surprise.\" â€¢ Hot Stove Tracker What did catch Goldschmidt -- and the rest of the baseball world, for that matter -- off guard was when news broke less than 24 hours later that the D-backs had agreed to terms with 2015 National League Cy Young runner-up Zack Greinke on a six-year, $206.5 million contract. \"I was definitely surprised,\" Goldschmidt said. \"All of a sudden my phone started blowing up with people texting and calling me. It was exciting.\" Since coming to the big leagues in August 2011, Goldschmidt has had more than his fair share of success against some of the NL's top pitchers. Greinke, though, held Goldschmidt to a .200 mark (5-for-25) and struck him out 13 times. \"He's one of the best in baseball,\" Goldschmidt said. \"It was always a fun challenge, but for us not to have to face him is pretty nice. Now, not only do we not have to face him, but he's on the mound for us. That's a huge boost.\" After the signing, D-backs manager Chip Hale said Greinke could help some of the D-backs' younger pitchers get to the next level, and left-hander Patrick Corbin said he was looking forward to learning from Greinke. Pitchers won't be the only ones that benefit, though. \"I'm sure he'll help out the entire pitching staff, setting the tone, and guys will be able to pick his brain because he's such a smart pitcher,\" Goldschmidt said. \"As an offensive guy, too, you can sometimes talk to pitchers and learn some things that can help you out as well.\" After signing Greinke, the D-backs had one more big move left, as they acquired right-hander Shelby Miller from the Braves. Miller's acquisition cost was high, as Arizona gave up outfielder Ender Inciarte and prospects Aaron Blair and Dansby Swanson. \"It definitely shows the front office has some confidence in us,\" Goldschmidt said. \"Ownership and the front office have made the commitment -- whether it's spending money or giving up prospects -- and now, from a player side, we have to go out and hold up our part of the bargain.\" Steve Gilbert is a reporter for MLB.com.
