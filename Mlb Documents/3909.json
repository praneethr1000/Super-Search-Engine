    "body": "NEW YORK -- The word \"energy\" became an inside catch-phrase for the Yankees' clubhouse last season, with Melky Cabrera's youthful spirit serving as a major driving force toward the team's second-half turnaround.  Though Cabrera's tenure in New York has been relatively brief, his hard-working demeanor has already made an impact both on the field and off. Cabrera is set to be honored in the Big Apple on Feb. 5, when he will be presented with the Thurman Munson Award for excellence in competition and philanthropic work within the community.  Cabrera is one of five sports stars who will be presented with \"Thurmans.\" Mets third baseman David Wright, former Houston Astros infielder Craig Biggio, New York Knicks shooting guard Jamal Crawford and Olympic gold medal-winning figure skater Kristi Yamaguchi will also be recognized at the 28th annual Thurman Munson Awards Dinner, to be held at the Marriott Marquis Hotel in Times Square. The AHRC New York City Foundation benefits from the gala, which remembers Munson, the late, great Yankees catcher and captain who died tragically in a 1979 plane crash.   Diana Munson, Thurman's widow, has been involved in the benefit since its inception, raising nearly $8 million to assist children and adults with developmental disabilities.   Len Berman of NBC Sports will serve as the master of ceremonies.   Cabrera, 23, made his greatest impact felt after assuming the everyday center-field job from the ailing Johnny Damon in midseason. Playing his second full Major League campaign, Cabrera batted .273 with eight home runs, 73 RBIs and 13 stolen bases for the Yankees in 2007.   Cabrera started 101 of the final 111 regular-season games in center field. Over that span, Cabrera batted .290, as the Yankees fared 72-39, on their way to securing the American League Wild Card.   A product of Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic, Cabrera was a non-drafted free agent who signed with the Yankees on Nov. 13, 2001. Cabrera's impressive season also featured an 18-game hitting streak from July 25 through Aug. 13, over which span he batted .400 (30-for-75), and a string of 30 consecutive games in which Cabrera reached base from July 25 through Aug. 27.   The Munson Awards Dinner has previously honored such notables as Willie Randolph, Mariano Rivera, Muhammad Ali, Yogi Berra, Goose Gossage, Don Mattingly, Jorge Posada, Joe Torre, Patrick Ewing, Bernie Williams, Arthur Ashe, Willis Reed, Earl Monroe, Willie Mays, Mark Messier, Mike Richter, Tom Seaver and John Franco.   Yankees right-hander Mike Mussina was among the award recipients last year.   The AHRC New York City Foundation is a not-for-profit organization that supports programs enabling children and adults with developmental disabilities to lead richer, more productive lives, including programs of AHRC New York City.   AHRC New York City is one of the largest organizations of its kind, serving 11,000 children and adults who have mental retardation, autism, cerebral palsy, traumatic brain injuries and other developmental disabilities.
