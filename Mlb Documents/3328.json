    "body": "Agent Scott Boras continues to pound the market for his prime client, Prince Fielder, and he may yet achieve his goal of a record deal for the free-agent first baseman.  Perhaps not financially, although there is a very good reason for believing that Boras is angling for a deal worth something like $24.7 million annually: Albert Pujols' recent 10-year agreement with the Angels breaks down to about $24.6 million a year.  Fielder may not get there -- a source told MLB.com on Wednesday that his price must come down in order for the Nationals to consider signing him. Nevertheless, with the meticulous way it's going, he remains likely to sign the latest megadeal in baseball history. Tom Singer is a national reporter for MLB.com. Follow @Tom_Singer on Twitter.
