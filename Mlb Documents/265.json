    "body": "CLEVELAND -- Coco Crisp remained an Indian at the end of the day Tuesday. Now that The Associated Press is reporting that Guillermo Mota failed his physical in Cleveland, it's possible Crisp could end up staying that way. The Tribe moved a step closer to shipping the popular outfielder to the Red Sox by having Mota in town for a physical that was generally regarded to be the last step in the days-long trade saga. Reports indicate the Tribe was planning to send Crisp, right-hander David Riske and backup catcher Josh Bard to Boston for Mota, third base prospect Andy Marte and catching prospect Kelly Shoppach.
