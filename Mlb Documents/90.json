    "body": "ST. PETERSBURG -- The Devil Rays went to the international market Wednesday to improve their bullpen and signed Shinji Mori to a two-year deal believed to be worth $1.5 million with a club option for another two years for an unspecified amount. \"Shinji Mori is a talented reliever who will add depth to our bullpen,\" said Rays executive vice president for baseball operations Andrew Friedman.  \"He's had a successful career in Japan, and we look forward to his continued success with the Devil Rays. This is the organization's first agreement with a player from the Japanese Leagues, and we hope this will lead to more opportunities in Asia.\" Wednesday was the final day the Rays could sign Mori, with whom they had been negotiating since December, when they outbid the Red Sox and Indians for the rights to the 31-year-old right-hander.  After winning the rights to Mori, the Rays had 30 days to work out a deal, based on the terms of the Japanese posting system. If they had not signed him, he would have pitched in Japan in 2006.   Mori was 44-44 with 50 saves and a 3.39 ERA in nine seasons with Seibu and had 755 strikeouts in 653 innings. He was a Pacific League All-Star in 2002, 2003 and 2004 and the league's top setup man in 2002-03.   In 2005, he went 2-2 with a 4.22 ERA in 48 games with five saves and struck out 60 in 49 innings.  Mori, who stands 6-foot-2, 194 pounds, was viewed as a power pitcher in Japan but also possesses a nice variety of pitches, which gives him some flexibility.   New Rays manager Joe Maddon announced the goal earlier in the offseason of having four go-to guys in the bullpen he can count on when the Rays are leading or are tied in the late innings.   Mori will likely be one of those four, or he might become the heir apparent to Joe Borowski as the team's setup man behind closer Danys Baez.  In addition to Baez and Mori, the Rays' bullpen should include Chad Orvella, Jesus Colome, Chad Harville, Travis Harper, Tim Corcoran and Lance Carter.  The Rays also are interested in veteran reliever Dan Miceli, a 35-year-old right-hander who's pitched 13 Major League seasons. In 2005, he went 1-2 with a 5.89 ERA in 19 appearances with Colorado before injuring his foot. Bill Chastain is a reporter for MLB.com.
