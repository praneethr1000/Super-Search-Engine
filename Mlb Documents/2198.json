    "body": "PHILADELPHIA -- Phillies outfielders Ben Revere and Domonic Brown filed for salary arbitration Tuesday. They are the club's only players eligible for arbitration. Revere and Brown were among the 175 players across the Major Leagues to file for arbitration before Tuesday's deadline. Arbitration-eligible players are generally those with between three and six years of Major League service. The next step in the salary arbitration process comes Friday, when the two sides will exchange binding salary proposals for one-year contracts. Revere and Brown are each in line for raises in 2015. Revere earned a base salary of $1.95 million in 2014 and finished the season tied for first in the National League with 184 hits. Brown will go through the arbitration process for the first time after earning $550,000 last season. The Phils previously avoided salary arbitration with left-hander Cesar Jimenez, agreeing in October to a one-year contract for the 2015 season. Austin Laymance is a reporter for MLB.com.
