    "body": "Major League clubs concerned about their pitchers throwing \"ahead of the calendar\" in the World Baseball Classic were reassured Thursday by strict pitch counts spelled out within a wide array of regulations for the March event announced by tournament officials.  As set forth by World Baseball Classic, Inc. (WBCI), pitchers will be limited to 65 pitches in Round One games, and be ineligible to pitch for four days following any outing of 50-plus pitches.  Also detailed are \"mercy rules\" for ending lopsided games, limitations on the number of participants from any Major League organization, replacement of injured players between rounds, and tie-breaking procedures to determine teams advancing in the three-tiered tournament. To warrant enforcement of the rules, there will be an addition to the game's lexicon: the Game Operations Technical Committee, which will be responsible for reporting pitchers at the limit to the umpire-in-chief, who will have the power to order pitching changes.
