    "body": "ARLINGTON -- Relief pitcher Mike Adams had surgery to repair a hernia a few weeks ago, and said Saturday he'll start Spring Training behind his teammates. Pitchers and catcher report Feb. 22. Adams said he'll start throwing in Corpus Christi next week. He said he had back pain during the season and was surprised to learn of the hernia after a visit to the doctor. \"Hopefully, by the time games start I should be ready to go and able,\" Adams said. \"I might be a week behind, but I don't see it in any way affecting me beyond mid-March.\" ",
