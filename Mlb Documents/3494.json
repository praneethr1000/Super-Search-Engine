    "body": "DENVER -- The Rockies and veteran left-handed pitcher Jamie Moyer have agreed on a Minor League contract with an invitation to Major League Spring Training, the club announced on Wednesday evening.  Moyer missed last season because of Tommy John surgery in his throwing elbow but vowed to attempt a comeback this season at age 49. Before the injury in 2011, Moyer went 9-9 with a 4.84 ERA in 19 starts for the Phillies. Each season from '07-09, Moyer reached double figures in wins with the Phillies. If he makes the club, Moyer will return to his post as his league's oldest player, a distinction he has held in five of the last eight years. Thomas Harding is a reporter for MLB.com.
