    "body": "PHILADELPHIA -- The Phillies' extended search for depth in the starting rotation brought them to Ryan Franklin, and culminated with a one-year, $2.6 million contract. General manager Pat Gillick knows Franklin from his days in Seattle, and hopes that the right-hander has left the frustrations of 2004-05 behind him. Franklin comes off two seasons with the Mariners in which he went 12-31 with a 4.99 ERA. He became a free agent last month when he was non-tendered. \"I don't want to say I wore out my welcome in Seattle, but I was ready to move on,\" said Franklin. \"I heard changes are good.\" Ken Mandel is a reporter for MLB.com.
