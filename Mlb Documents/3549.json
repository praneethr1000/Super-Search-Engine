    "body": "ARLINGTON -- Jurickson Profar had an offensive power surge at Class A Hickory last summer. At 18 years old, Profar hit 37 doubles, eight triples, 12 home runs and finished with a .493 slugging percentage.  That's pretty impressive for a 5-foot-11, 165-pound shortstop playing in his first full season in the Minor Leagues. But that's not what impressed Hickory manager Bill Richardson the most about a player who has now risen to become the No. 1 prospect in the Rangers organization.  \"Generally when you see a guy with power, he's still struggling with his strikeouts,\" Richardson said. \"But this kid's walks to strikeouts stayed level: 65 walks and 63 strikeouts. He has incredible high-level hand\/eye coordination. When we just needed a single he would have these 13-pitch at-bats and knew how to put the ball in play.\" Profar, among his many accomplishments, finished 25th in the South Atlantic League in slugging percentage. Out of that group, he was the only player with at least 200 at-bats who had more walks than strikeouts. Bryce Harper, the Nationals' highly regarded hitting prospect, had 44 walks against 61 strikeouts.            T.R. Sullivan is a reporter for MLB.com.
