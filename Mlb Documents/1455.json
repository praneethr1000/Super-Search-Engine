    "body": "OAKLAND -- The A's agreed to terms on a one-year contract with right-hander Chris Resop on Thursday, avoiding arbitration.  The recently acquired Resop, reeled in via trade from Pittsburgh on Nov. 30, is reportedly set to make $1.35 million in 2013.  The 30-year-old righty only further deepens an already talented A's relief corps that includes the likes of Grant Balfour, Ryan Cook and Sean Doolittle. Resop tossed a career-high 73 2\/3 innings for the Pirates last season, compiling a 3.91 ERA along the way. The A's still have four players on their roster eligible for arbitration: Jerry Blevins, George Kottaras, Brandon Moss and Seth Smith. Teams and players submit arbitration salary figures on Jan. 18.
