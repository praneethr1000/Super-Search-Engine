    "body": "MILWAUKEE -- Seth McClung is returning to the place he says feels like home.  McClung, a fan-favorite from the Brewers' run to the 2008 National League Wild Card berth, has signed a Minor League deal with Milwaukee that does not include an invitation to Major League Spring Training camp -- but it does offer the chance to rejoin a franchise with which he's comfortable.  \"I'm going to have to go down to the Minor League camp and work down there,\" he said. \"But they're going to give me some of those innings in Spring Training when they need the young guys to come up. I wouldn't have done that for any other team than Milwaukee.\" Adam McCalvy is a reporter for MLB.com. Read his blog, Brew Beat, and follow him on Twitter at @AdamMcCalvy.
