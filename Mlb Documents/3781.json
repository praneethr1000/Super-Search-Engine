    "body": "Former Yankee Chuck Knoblauch said he was not angry about being named in the Mitchell Report but said he has nothing to hide, The New York Times reported on Friday.  Knoblauch, in his first public comments since the Mitchell Report was released on Dec. 13, described the report as \"crazy\" and \"interesting.\"  According to the Mitchell Report, Knoblauch and former Yankees teammates Roger Clemens and Andy Pettitte were all drug customers of Clemens' personal trainer, Brian McNamee. Pettitte has admitted to taking human growth hormone to overcome an injury, while Clemens has disputed the Report's allegations that he used steroids and HGH. Knoblauch declined to comment on the Report's allegation that he began using HGH in 2001. All three players are expected to appear together at a hearing before a Congressional committee on Feb. 13.   \"I have nothing to defend,\" Knoblauch told the Times. \"I have nothing to hide at the same time.\"      \"I've got nothing to do with any of that, I mean, any baseball,\" Knoblauch said. \"And I don't want anything to do with baseball.\"   Knoblauch told the Times that no one on the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform had contacted him yet.   \"I read my name in the paper and see it on the news, but I haven't heard a word,\" Knoblauch said. \"I'm supposed to be somewhere, but I haven't been told where to be.\"   Asked if he will talk to the committee, Knoblauch told the Times: \"Yeah, if I have to do that, then what are you going to do?\" Jim Molony is a writer for MLB.com.
