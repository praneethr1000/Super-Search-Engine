    "body": "KANSAS CITY -- Royals catcher Salvador Perez confirmed Friday that his agents and the Royals have been involved in discussions to rework his contract. Does Perez think a new deal will get done before Spring Training next month? \"I don't know,\" he said. \"I got my agents they are talking to. We'll see. \"We have to wait for it. I'm happy either way. I'm happy no matter what. I'm here to play the game.\" Perez said he is not spending much time thinking about a new deal. \"That's why I got my agent,\" he said. \"If something happens, great. If not, that's great, too. \"I don't care. I'll just play hard and keep my concentration and help my teammates. [And] try to get back to the World Series.\" Perez, the reigning World Series Most Valuable Player, signed a five-year, $7 million deal in 2012 that includes three club option years in '17 ($3.825M), '18 ($5.15M) and '19 ($6.3M). The deal has been increasingly viewed as overly club-friendly, though at the time it was signed, it was a rather risky venture for the Royals because Perez had played in only 39 games. Two weeks after signing it, Perez sent a scare into the club when he tore a ligament in his knee and missed over two months. The Royals are not commenting on the contract renegotiation.
