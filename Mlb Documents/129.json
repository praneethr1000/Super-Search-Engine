    "body": "Though the Red Sox and Orioles continue to talk regarding a Manny Ramirez-Miguel Tejada blockbuster, precious little progress has been made this week and Ramirez said Thursday he is now focused on another season in Boston.  \"There will be no trade, I'm staying in Boston, where I'm familiar with the system and where I have a lot of friends, especially David Ortiz,\" Ramirez told espndeportes.com while in Miami on personal business. \"I'm going to take things easy and focus on my career.\"  Ramirez is a 10\/5 player -- at least 10 years in the Majors and at least five in a row with the same club -- so he certainly can end any discussions just like that. But does that mean he's going to be patrolling Fenway Park's outfield regularly again? Not necessarily. This is the same player who practically yesterday was demanding a way out.
