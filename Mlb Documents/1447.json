    "body": "PHILADELPHIA -- Is there anything to worry about here? Phillies general manager Ruben Amaro Jr. said Thursday that left-hander Cole Hamels' shoulder is fine. CSNPhilly.com reported Hamels had some shoulder soreness late in the 2012 season and early in the offseason. But the Phils shut down Hamels' throwing program for a couple of weeks and he has been fine since, Amaro said.  \"We really weren't concerned,\" Amaro said. \"If we were concerned or had any concern, then he would have or would be seeing a doctor. We had none of that. If there are problems that come up in Spring Training, then we'll deal with them. But there is no indication that Cole has an issue right now.\" The Phillies hope so. Hamels, 29, signed a six-year, $144 million contract extension last summer, and they need him healthy if they expect to return to the postseason in 2013. Todd Zolecki is a reporter for MLB.com.
