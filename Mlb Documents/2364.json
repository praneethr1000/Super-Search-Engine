    "body": "The Cubs and newly acquired outfielder Dexter Fowler avoided arbitration and reached agreement on a one-year deal worth $9.5 million. Fowler, 28, was acquired Monday from the Astros for right-handed pitcher Dan Straily and infielder Luis Valbuena. The Cubs had inherited the arbitration figures which the Astros exchanged last week; Fowler asked for $10.8 million, and Houston countered at $8.5 million. Last season, Fowler batted .276 with four triples, eight home runs, 35 RBIs and scored 61 runs in 116 games. Joey Nowak is a reporter for MLB.com. Follow him on Twitter at @joeynowak.
