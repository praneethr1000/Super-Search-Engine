    "body": "CLEVELAND -- We might not know what species Slider -- the Indians' mascot -- is, but we do know that the rotund creature that roams Progressive Field is a member of the Mascot Hall of Fame. Now, Slider is up for another honor.  Slider is one of four mascots in the mix to be named the Most Awesome Mascot as part of the Cartoon Network's Hall of Game Awards. The other nominees include Slamson of the NBA's Sacramento Kings, Jaxson De Ville of the NFL's Jacksonville Jaguars and S.J. Sharkie of the NHL's San Jose Sharks.  Slider -- a fuzzy fuchsia creature with a big yellow nose and bushy yellow eyebrows -- is the lone mascot representing Major League Baseball. It was inducted into the Mascot Hall of Fame in 2008. Fans can vote for Slider by visiting the Cartoon Network's website.",
