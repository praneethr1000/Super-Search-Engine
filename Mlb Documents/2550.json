    "subtitle": "Club would avoid arbitration with outfielder, who is slated for backup role in 2015",
    "body": "The Giants and outfielder Gregor Blanco have agreed to a two-year, $7.5 million contract to avoid arbitration, according to a report from the San Francisco Chronicle, which cited Venezuelan outlet Lider en Deportes. The club did not confirm the deal. The 31-year-old Blanco has appeared in at least 140 games in each of the last three seasons for the Giants. He hit .260\/.333\/.374 with 16 stolen bases last season, playing left field before moving to center in place of the injured Angel Pagan. Blanco will shift to a backup role with this week's reported signing of Nori Aoki, but provides valuable experience at all three outfield positions and speed off the bench. He is a .257\/.344\/.344 career hitter over parts of six Major League seasons with the Braves, Royals and Giants. Cash Kruth is a reporter for MLB.com. Follow him on Twitter at @cashkruth.
