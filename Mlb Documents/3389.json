    "body": "OAKLAND -- Nick Swisher initially gained attention as a central figure in \"Moneyball,\" Michael Lewis' best-selling account of the A's cost-efficient methods of obtaining and evaluating players. Thursday, Swisher became the protagonist in an entirely new tale -- Oakland's extensive effort to replenish its talent base. The A's rebuilding process accelerated as they traded Swisher to the Chicago White Sox for two top pitching prospects, left-hander Gio Gonzalez and right-hander Fautino De Los Santos, and outfielder Ryan Sweeney. Five of the nine acquisitions are pitchers, including four left-handers. That's by design. \"The best chance for longterm success is to have pitching you've developed that you can have for a long time,\" Beane said, noting that should the A's succeed with their revamped personnel, they won't have to make trades like this in upcoming seasons.
