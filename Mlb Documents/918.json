    "body": "ANAHEIM -- Angels superstar center fielder Mike Trout was voted by fans in a recent online poll to be featured on card No. 1 for the 2016 Topps Baseball set. Trout's card will depict his improbable catch from Sept. 26, when he scaled the wall at Angel Stadium to rob Jesus Montero of a home run -- arguably the most impressive defensive play of the season. \"It's awesome,\" Trout said in a statement released by Topps. \"I appreciate the support from fans across MLB. It's pretty special to be the No. 1 card for Topps.\"  Say hello to the face of @toppscards Card No. 1 for 2016... @MikeTrout  Thanks to all who voted. #Angels pic.twitter.com\/re31JnDs88 Jackie Robinson, Willie Mays and Derek Jeter are among those who have previously earned the distinction. Topps Baseball Series 1 will be released on Wednesday, marking 65 years of producing baseball cards. David Leiner, vice president and general manager of North American sports and entertainment for Topps, noted in a statement that \"the first card in the Topps baseball set has historically been given to top players or has been meaningful. \"This time around, we wanted our collectors to be part of the 65th Topps Baseball set, and they made their mark by picking one of the best players in baseball today.\" Alden Gonzalez is a reporter for MLB.com.
