    "body": "ARLINGTON -- The Rangers have had their meeting with free-agent pitcher Roy Oswalt. There is no word yet if Texas will actually sign him, as a source said the situation remains ongoing and unresolved.  If the Rangers sign Oswalt, they would be adding a proven, experienced Major League pitcher to their 40-man roster. They would be signing a two-time 20-game winner who was clearly a No. 1 starter in his prime.  They would also have unprecedented starting-pitching depth. There were years in the Rangers' history when they would have gladly settled for a rotation consisting of the sixth-through the 10th-best starters on their current roster. There are teams in the Major Leagues right now that would be thrilled to have that for their current rotation. T.R. Sullivan is a reporter for MLB.com.
