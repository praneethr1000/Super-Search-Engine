    "body": "The Dodgers have signed free-agent right-hander Brandon Beachy to a one-year contract on Wednesday. Terms of the deal weren't announced, but Yahoo's Jeff Passan reported Beachy will receive $1.5 million. To create room on the 40-man roster, the Dodgers designated left-handed pitcher Tyler Olson for assignment. The 29-year-old Beachy, who signed a one-year, $2.75 million deal with a $3 million club option before the 2015 season, made just two starts for the Dodgers last season after missing most of 2013 and all of '14 following his second Tommy John surgery. He had his first surgery midway through the 2012 season. Hot Stove Tracker Before his injuries, Beachy flashed great potential with the Braves by going 7-3 with a 3.68 ERA in 2011 and then posting a 2.00 ERA in 13 starts before seeing his 2012 season end. Since his first surgery, however, Beachy is just 2-2 with a 5.21 ERA in seven starts. Cash Kruth is a reporter for MLB.com. Follow him on Twitter at @cashkruth.
