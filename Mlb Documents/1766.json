    "body": "SAN FRANCISCO -- The Giants and infielder Joaquin Arias avoided salary arbitration by agreeing Friday on a one-year, $925,000 deal. As is often the case, the sides settled at the midpoint between the club's offer and the player's filing figure. San Francisco offered $750,000 to Arias, who filed for $1.1 million when figures were exchanged last Friday. Arias became the fifth arbitration-eligible Giant to avoid an arbitration hearing, joining catcher Buster Posey, right fielder Hunter Pence, left-hander Jose Mijares and outfielder Gregor Blanco. Right-hander Sergio Romo, who developed into the Giants' closer as they advanced toward their World Series triumph last season, is the team's lone remaining arbitration-eligible player who has not come to terms. Romo filed for $4.5 million; the Giants countered with $2,675,000. Chris Haft is a reporter for MLB.com. This story was not subject to the approval of Major League Baseball or its clubs.",
