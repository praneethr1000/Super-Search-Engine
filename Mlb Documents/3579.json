    "body": "ANAHEIM -- Angels owner Arte Moreno, fresh off reeling in Albert Pujols and C.J. Wilson this offseason, has been named the 2011 Sports Executive of the Year by the Los Angeles Sports Council.  Moreno will be presented his award during the seventh annual LA Sports Awards, which celebrate the greatest moments of the year in the Los Angeles\/Orange County area, on March 15 at Club Nokia at L.A. Live.  Moreno purchased the Angels from the Walt Disney Company in 2003, becoming the first Hispanic owner of a major sports team in the U.S. Under his watch, the Angels have made the playoffs five times and ranked in the top eight in the Majors in payroll for eight straight years, beginning in '04. This past season, the Halos outdrew the Dodgers for the first time. And on Dec. 8, Moreno spent nearly $330 million to sign both Pujols and Wilson to long-term contracts.   The awards show will be televised by FOX Sports West (air dates to be announced) and will also feature a countdown of the top 10 moments of '11, along with the naming of the Sportsman, Sportswoman and Coach of the Year.   Moreno also won the executive award in '05. Alden Gonzalez is a reporter for MLB.com. Read his columns and his blog, listen to his podcast and follow him on Twitter.
