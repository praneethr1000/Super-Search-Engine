    "subtitle": "",
    "body": "The Red Sox have signed Daniel Nava to a one-year, non-guaranteed contract worth $1.85 million for the 2015 season, the team announced Thursday, avoiding arbitration. Nava, 31, appeared in 113 games for Boston in 2014, hitting .270 with 21 doubles, four homers and 37 RBIs. He also spent 24 games at Triple-A Pawtucket. Where Nava fits into the team's packed outfield is unclear. The Red Sox's 40-man roster includes Hanley Ramirez, Rusney Castillo, Mookie Betts, Shane Victorino, Allen Craig, Jackie Bradley Jr., Bryce Brentz and Nava for three spots in the outfield. Nava could also see time at first base, where he played 11 games last season. Left-hander Wade Miley is Boston's only remaining arbitration-eligible player. Jamal Collier is a reporter for MLB.com.
