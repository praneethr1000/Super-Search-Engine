    "body": "DENVER -- Rockies shortstop Jose Reyes has a trial date of April 4 -- Opening Day -- on a domestic violence charge stemming from an Oct. 31 incident in Maui, Hawaii, the New York Daily News reported Friday. Reyes' case is already being investigated under a joint Major League Baseball-Players Association domestic violence policy instituted in 2015. Commissioner Rob Manfred is expected to rule on the case, possibly before Spring Training begins and no later than March 1, according to recent reports. Under the policy, the Commissioner does not have to wait until the case is tried to make a ruling, and has the power to order a suspension as well as counseling for Reyes. The Rockies are scheduled to open the regular season at Chase Field against the D-backs on Opening Day. Contacted Friday morning, the Rockies declined to comment beyond referring to their original statement, dated Nov. 9, which read: \"We were extremely disappointed and concerned to learn of the allegations involving Jose Reyes. We continue to gather information and will address this matter appropriately, in accordance with Major League Baseball's Joint Domestic Violence, Sexual Assault and Child Abuse Policy.\" The club referred further questions to MLB. \"Our goal remains to complete our own investigations as quickly as we can without sacrificing the thoroughness of the investigations,\" Michael Teevan, MLB vice president of communications, said on Friday. The Daily News reported that Maui County deputy prosecuting attorney Kerry Glen confirmed the April 4 trial date, and quoted Glen as saying a plea offer before trial was possible. \"If I find that acceptable, we would enter into that agreement,\" Glenn told the newspaper. \"There is always potential for additional negotiating between now and then.\" It is unclear if Reyes is a U.S. citizen, a factor that could cause further problems if he is convicted. According to a legal expert quoted by the Daily News, Reyes could potentially face deportation if it turns out he is not a citizen. The paper referred to a 2008 story that said Reyes had begun the process of becoming a U.S. citizen, but \"it is unclear if he reached that status.\" The Rockies and MLB declined to discuss Reyes' citizenship status.
