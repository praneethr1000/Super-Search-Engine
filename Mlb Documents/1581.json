    "body": "SPRING, Texas -- On the day viewers of MLB Network voted him as the \"Face of the Franchise,\" the stubbled face of Jose Altuve sported a smile as the Astros second baseman took the news in stride, which should come as a shock to no one.  Altuve has handled every label placed on him during his career, beginning with \"undersized.\" A player many thought was too small to play at a high level earned a new label last season: \"National League All-Star.\" And he did it in the same carefree manner in which he plays the game. For Altuve, getting a chance to play baseball is all that matters to him.  After admitting at the end of last season -- his first full year in the Major Leagues -- that he was worn out, Altuve looked rested and eager to begin Spring Training on Tuesday when he joined teammates Tyler Greene and Wesley Wright and former Astros pitcher Shane Reynolds at the club's CAREavan stops.
