    "body": "ST. PETERSBURG -- Former Devil Ray Fred McGriff won't be getting into the Baseballl Hall of Fame in 2016 after coming up short on Baseball Writers' Association of America votes Wednesday in his seventh year on the ballot. The Tampa native received 92 votes, or 20.9 percent. Candidates must be named on 75 percent of the ballots in order to be elected. McGriff needed to be named on at least five percent of the ballots to remain on the ballot. Former Devil Ray Randy Winn did not earn a vote, which means he will not be on next year's ballot. McGriff was an original Devil Ray, starting at first base in the team's first game against the Tigers at Tropicana Field on March 31, 1998. During part of five seasons with the Rays, the \"Crime Dog\" hit .291 with 99 home runs and 359 RBIs. McGriff's best season with the Rays came in 1999, when he hit .310 with 32 home runs and 104 RBIs. In 19 Major League seasons, McGriff hit .284 with 493 home runs and 1,550 RBIs. In addition, he won three Silver Slugger Awards, made the All-Star team five times and has the distinction of leading both leagues in home runs (American League, 1989; National League, '92). During a career spent with six teams, McGriff was a model of consistency, hitting 30 home runs in seven consecutive seasons and 10 times overall. His career high came in 1993, when he hit 37 while splitting time with the Padres and Braves. Winn, who played for the Rays from 1998 to 2002, earned a 2002 All-Star selection in center field. He went on to lead AL outfielders in putouts in 2004. He hit .300 or better three times and posted a perfect 1.000 fielding percentage over 146 games in the outfield in 2009.
