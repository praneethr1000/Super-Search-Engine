    "body": "Gary Carter ignited one of the most stunning rallies in World Series history. He started the New York Mets' memorable three-run comeback with a two-out single in the 10th inning of Game 6 against the Boston Red Sox in the 1986 Series.  You know the rest -- Mookie Wilson's epic grounder shot through Bill Buckner's legs and the Mets won, 6-5, and went on to take the championship in seven games.  This was the defining moment of Carter's career, a classic example of what he was all about. None was better than The Kid at seizing the moment. Throughout his Hall of Fame career, Carter had a knack for turning defeats into victories. It was his exuberance, his faith and his determination that reversed the tide.   Especially his faith.   I keep thinking of that as The Kid battles an aggressive form of brain cancer that has put him in an extremely grave situation.   \"This is an unbelievable journey, nothing I could have ever imagined,\" Carter has said. \"God is helping me get through this.\"   Ten days ago, an MRI exam revealed \"several new spots\/tumors\" on his brain, turning his situation to its precarious condition.   \"I'm not feeling too good,\" Carter told Bill Madden of the New York Daily News over the phone several weeks ago. \"It's been coming on and coming on. I've had a chest cold. I've got sores in my mouth, blood clots. I get sick; there's just so many things. ... It's been nine months now and I don't feel any different from Day 1. I just haven't been up to doing any interviews.\"   I got to know The Kid -- nicknamed because of his childlike, upbeat persona -- well over his 19 years as a player.   The thing I remember most is no matter the situation, win or lose, he was available and gracious to reporters like me. From the first time we met, he always remembered my name, never refused to return a phone call or answer a question.   There is something about Gary Carter that makes you feel good after talking with him.  The first time was at the 1981 All-Star Game in Cleveland's Municipal Stadium, the resumption of play after the 50-day players strike. He had made the 1977 All-Star team as a rookie, but '81 was his first start.   Gary blasted two home runs, the National League won 5-4, and he was named MVP.   This was quite an introduction to the Montreal Expos catcher, who would go on to be elected to the Hall of Fame in 2003.   Later that year, in the first-half-second-half playoff created because of the strike, The Kid almost single-handedly eliminated the defending World Series champion Phillies from the postseason. He batted .421 with two homers and six RBIs in the best-of-five tournament.   Having covered much of his career with the Expos and Mets, and his induction to the Hall of Fame on his sixth year of eligibility, what he is going through is difficult to believe, almost impossible to accept.   During his 19-year playing career, Carter had nine knee operations, but refused to let them hamper his career as one of the best catchers in the Major Leagues.   \"All I ever wanted to do was play,\" he said. \"I never feared embarrassing myself. If I am remembered, I hope it's more for giving it all I had and playing hard every day.\"   It has occurred to me this disease has an unkind, if not uncanny, tie to baseball.   From the 1980 World Series between the Phillies and Royals, it proved fatal to relievers Dan Quisenberry and Tug McGraw and infielder John Vukovich.   It also has taken Bobby Murcer, Dick Howser and Johnny Oates.   Carter, who always wanted to manage in the Major Leagues, was appointed coach at Palm Beach (Fla.) Atlantic University in 2009. His daughter, Kimmy Bloemers, is the softball coach there.   When Carter's team opens its season Thursday night at Roger Dean Stadium, his No. 8 jersey will hang in the dugout. Carter has not been to the college since September.   I'm certain, as The Kid battles this dreadful disease, he remembers the defining moment of the 1986 World Series.   There were two out in the 10th, and with Carter at bat, the Mets were down to their last out. One more out and the Red Sox were World Series champions. But Carter singled to begin the three-run rally that kept Boston from winning.   \"The biggest thing that was going through my mind is that I reflected back upon my days in the alleyway dreaming about this,\" Carter told the New Times' Tyler Kepner in 1990. \"You always think World Series, bottom of the ninth, two outs, that kind of stuff.   \"And then, I felt an extreme presence and I knew that our good Lord was with us. I felt like when I went up to the plate, I was not going to make the last out. I prayed from the time I left the on-deck circle to the time I got in the box.\"   That's the moment when he's at his best.  And we pray for that.  Hal Bodley is the senior correspondent for MLB.com.
