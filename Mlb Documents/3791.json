    "body": "NEW YORK -- Two years ago, with a similar class of first-timers on the National Baseball Hall of Fame ballot, Bruce Sutter was finally ushered in as the first pure reliever elected to the museum on Main Street in Cooperstown, N.Y.  The baseball world will find out Tuesday if the same thing will happen to Rich \"Goose\" Gossage, one of the premier closers of his generation and on the ballot for the ninth time.  \"I don't think anybody did it the way I did it,\" said Gossage, who garnered 71.2 percent last year and missed by just 21 votes. \"Power against power. There was no messing around. All those strikeouts I had, none of that is padding. Just about every one of them meant something because the game was on the line.\" Eleven newcomers are on the ballot, but none of them are seen as sure-fire winners, as was the case last year when Tony Gwynn and Cal Ripken Jr. were elected overwhelmingly in their inaugural appearances. That could open the door to other long-time hopefuls like Jim Rice and Andre Dawson, who were fourth and fifth behind Ripken, Gwynn and Gossage last year.           Barry M.
