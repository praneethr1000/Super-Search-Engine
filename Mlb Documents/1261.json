    "body": "CHANDLER, Ariz. -- Take a creative business concept and a team president with a zany sense of humor and this is the result: the Arizona Diamondbacks' second annual Most Valuable Partner Awards on Thursday night at the Wild Horse Pass Hotel & Casino.  The emcee was Derrick Hall, the club president, who dressed up as Elvis, complete with gold robe and big, dark glasses, and who imitated Frank Sinatra, singing his own adapted lyrics of \"My Way\" to a crowd full of corporate sponsors:  \"And now, the end is near. Your contract's up. Last year together ... Through it all, this is baseball. We want you to stay.\" Barry M. Bloom is national reporter for MLB.com and writes an MLBlog, Boomskie on Baseball.
