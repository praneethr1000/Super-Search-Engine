    "body": "This weekend is your last chance to choose who you think is a worthy Hall of Famer, as MLB.com's unofficial fan balloting ends at 11:59 p.m. ET Sunday. Results of the fan ballot will be presented on Monday, one day before Tuesday's official Hall of Fame ballot results are announced live on MLB.com by Hall of Fame President Dale Petroskey at 2 p.m. ET.  Don Mattingly, Goose Gossage and Andre Dawson led the way after the most recent tally of votes, but closely bunched just behind them were Jim Rice, Orel Hershiser, Lee Smith, Bruce Sutter, Dale Murphy, Tommy John and Steve Garvey. A flurry of votes this weekend could push any of these former stars into the upper tier.  Other players on this year's ballot also include, Will Clark, Bert Blyleven, Dwight Gooden, Dave Parker, John Wetteland and current White Sox manager Ozzie Guillen, to name a few.
