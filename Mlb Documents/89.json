    "body": "BRADENTON, Fla. -- For the majority of players who are participating this week in the Pittsburgh Pirates' sixth annual minicamp, the opening of the voluntary camp on Wednesday was little more than an opportunity to meet the new coaching staff, work off some of the winter rust and show the training staff that they have been adhering to their offseason conditioning programs.  For pitchers Sean Burnett and John Van Benschoten, however, it was much more than that. In fact, the former No. 1 draft picks, both of whom spent all of last season on the disabled list, probably had Jan. 11, 2006 circled on their calendars a long, long time ago.  After months of rehabilitation, Burnett and Van Benschoten were given the green light to return to the mound on Wednesday. Each threw approximately two dozen pitches in their bullpen sessions.
