    "body": "Alex Rodriguez reached out to Major League Baseball and incoming Commissioner Rob Manfred this week as he prepares to return to the field with the Yankees following a one-year suspension for violation of the Joint Drug Prevention and Treatment Program. The purpose of Rodriguez's visit to MLB's offices at 245 Park Avenue in New York was to clear the air as he prepares to attempt to resurrect his career, according to the New York Post, which first reported the story. Manfred was Commissioner Bud Selig's point man for the Biogenesis investigation that led to the suspension of A-Rod and 13 others. In what was viewed as an apology and reconciliation, Rodriguez arrived without representation from the Major League Baseball Players Association or personal attorneys. Paul Hagen is a reporter for MLB.com. This story was not subject to the approval of Major League Baseball or its clubs.",
