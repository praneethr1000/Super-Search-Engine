    "body": "Trevor May was the valedictorian of his high school class, so he's smart enough to know how quickly things can change. A year ago, the right-hander seemed to have a promising future, but there were question marks. May was coming off a season in which he had been dropped from high Class A Clearwater to low Class A Lakewood after posting a 5.01 ERA for the Florida State League Threshers. Back with Clearwater last year, though, May had an eye-popping 208 strikeouts in 151 1\/3 innings, third most in all of Minor League baseball. He became the first Phillies Minor Leaguer since Mark Davis in 1985 to whiff at least 180 batters, and May held opposing hitters to a .221 average. By midseason, May had established himself as one of the team's Baby Aces, along with Jarred Cosart and Brody Colvin.  And by the time the schedule was completed, May had set himself apart. He was named the Paul Owens Award winner as the most outstanding pitcher in the Phillies' organization. May was rated the team's No. 4 prospect by MLB.com at the end of the season, and he's their No. 1 prospect according to Baseball America.  He's trying to keep it all in perspective.  \"There's been a little more attention,\" May said. \"Hype, I like to call it. But as for the approach to the game or how I'm preparing for the season, if anything, it's given me more motivation to work hard.  \"To be named the top prospect, a lot of things happen. Just like there are injuries in the big leagues and guys move up that you never would have thought at the beginning of the season. We've had trades. We've had things happen. Domonic [Brown] had enough big league at-bats not to be considered to get the honor. Before I knew it, I was in this spot. And I'm happy to be here.  \"I hope I can live up to the expectations. I plan on it.  To help make that happen, May has dabbled in yoga to add flexibility. And he's determined not to let the accolades become a distraction.  \"With all this attention you get in the offseason, because there's no baseball, you can go from being a good player to a great player without even throwing a ball,\" May said with a smile. \"You've got to just try to keep your head straight on your shoulders and your eye on the prize. And that's what I'm trying to do.\"  May is well aware that there are matters beyond his control. Once, he dreamed of making it to the big leagues with Cosart and Colvin. Then Cosart was traded to the Astros as part of the deal that brought Hunter Pence to Citizens Bank Park.  All May can do is pitch as well as he can. He knows that from experience.  \"Some guys have bad years and fall out of grace, so to speak,\" May said. \"I had one of those years and wasn't as highly thought of as I was before. Anything can happen. There was a good example -- Sergio Escalona. A couple years ago, he was in Lakewood. And by the end of the next year, he was making his debut in the big leagues. So all it takes is a few good starts and things fall in place, and before you know it, you're in the big leagues and you never come down again.  \"Sometimes it happens that way. Sometimes it takes a long time. You never know. The goal is to be ready as soon as possible.\"  Said Clearwater pitching coach Dave Lundquist: \"He'll show you a power fastball as well as a 12-6 breaking ball and, at times, an above-average changeup. We're making steady progress on getting a consistent delivery so he's able to drive the ball down.\"  Being able to repeat pitches is the goal.  \"That's always been my motto: The more consistent I get, the better the results and the better chance we have to win as a team,\" May said. \"It's all coming together, so hopefully, we'll see something closer to the complete picture here soon.\"  Assistant general manager of player personnel Benny Looper knows there are no guarantees, but he believes the former fourth-round Draft choice out of Kelso (Wash.) High School has the potential for a bright future.  \"Trevor's strikeout totals were very indicative of his progression in our Minor League system,\" Looper said.  Things can change quickly in baseball. For May, it's all been for the better lately, and he's determined to keep going in that direction. Paul Hagen is a reporter for MLB.com.
