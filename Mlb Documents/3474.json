    "body": "What a week for the American League Central Division.  The recent injury to Detroit Tigers designated hitter\/catcher Victor Martinez has tremendous ramifications for the team and the rest of the AL Central.  While preparing for the coming season, the switch-hitting Martinez, 33, tore his left anterior cruciate ligament and may be lost for the entire 2012 season following surgery. The anterior cruciate is one of four major knee ligaments. In the United States, it is believed 200,000 surgeries are performed annually to repair torn knee ligaments. Of those, one to eight percent of the surgeries fail to repair the ligament to full strength. During his first season in Detroit, Martinez -- who signed a four-year deal prior to the 2011 season -- was a formidable run producer who hit for average and power in the middle of the Tigers lineup, hitting .330 with 12 home runs and 103 RBIs. His home runs dipped by eight from his 2010 total, but he was a feared hitter with the ability to break open a game with a timely double to the gap, of which he hit 40 in '11.   Of critical importance is the protection Martinez consistently provided Miguel Cabrera, and that protection should not be undervalued. Cabrera saw much better pitches to hit because of the presence of Martinez.   Much of the damage Cabrera inflicted on opposing pitchers was born out of a choice they had to make between the sluggers. Now, Martinez's potent bat will likely be removed from the equation for all of the upcoming season, which could offer pitchers more freedom to work around Cabrera. Barring the acquisition of a remaining free-agent bat, the Tigers have been severely weakened offensively.   One potential designated hitter replacement for Martinez is off the market. Carlos Pena, a Tiger from 2002-05, has signed with Tampa Bay. There are other strong hitters still available such as Vladimir Guerrero, who is the type of seasoned hitter capable of offering middle of the order contact and power. Of course, the Tigers are familiar with Magglio Ordonez and Carlos Guillen, former Tigers who remain unsigned. Outfielder Juan Pierre may be attractive with his ability to get on base and steal his way into scoring position. While he wouldn't come close to replacing Martinez's power, Pierre may bring the benefit of giving the Tigers' more speed at the top of the lineup in front of Cabrera.   If the Tigers don't improve their offense, they can still rely on their deep starting pitching to lead them to victories. The rotation currently includes Justin Verlander, Doug Fister, Max Scherzer, Rick Porcello and possibly top prospect Jacob Turner, who possesses one of the strongest young arms in baseball. Yet, the club may seek another starting pitcher in an effort to round out the back of the rotation, so it can ease Turner into a big league role.   The Tigers are not alone when it comes to questions in the rotation. The Indians suddenly find themselves with a significant concern at the front of their staff, following Fausto Carmona's arrest in the Dominican Republic for allegedly falsifying his identity. Dominican authorities indicate his correct name is Roberto Hernandez Heredia, and he is reported to be 31 years old, not 28 as listed by the Indians.   Carmona was the Opening Day starter for the Tribe last season. He had pitched in the Dominican this winter, flashing improvement in his command and providing Cleveland with the hope he returned to the form that earned him accolades in 2007 -- the year he won 19 games and fashioned a 3.06 ERA.   Carmona was being counted upon to be an important part of the Indians rotation, but now his presence on the team is in question. His ability to get the proper paperwork to leave the Dominican and pitch in the United States is in doubt. With less than a month until the arrival of pitchers and catchers at Spring Training, the Indians have to re-think their starting pitching plans.   Acting quickly after learning of the Carmona arrest, Cleveland traded prospect reliever Zach Putnam to Colorado for right-handed pitcher Kevin Slowey.   Putnam marks the fourth Cleveland pitching prospect to be traded to Colorado in the past year. Last season, left-hander Drew Pomeranz, and right-handers Alex White and Joe Gardner were traded to the Rockies in a deal that brought right-hander Ubaldo Jimenez to Cleveland.   Slowey, at one time a highly regarded prospect of the Minnesota Twins, is capable of taking a spot in Cleveland's rotation. The 27-year-old Slowey was the Twins second-round selection in the 2005 First-Year Player Draft, but was traded to Colorado for right-hander Daniel Turpen.   Slowey was seen as a viable option in Minnesota's future pitching plans until he scuffled badly last season after returning from injury. In 2011 in Minnesota, Slowey threw 59.1 innings, gave up 78 hits, walked only five while striking out 34. However, he never found a winning formula and ended the season with a 0-8 record and 6.67 ERA in 14 games (eight starts).   Slowey's command of an average fastball is good. He pitches to specific spots representing a hitter's weaknesses, but to date in his career he has shown himself to be hittable. Using a very smooth delivery and good overall pitching mechanics, Slowey's high-80s to low-90s fastball isn't overpowering, but he mixes in a slider, curveball and changeup to help keep hitters off-balance. For most clubs, Slowey might be best suited as a back end of the rotation pitcher or more likely as an emergency starter.   However, in the current situation, pending the acquisition of another starter or the return of Carmona, Slowey may well be in the Indians rotation. He may also have to compete with left-hander David Huff and right-handers Zach McAllister and Jeanmar Gomez. Regardless, it appears the Indians pitching depth has been weakened if Carmona is unable to pitch next season in the United States. For now, Cleveland has not terminated Carmona's contract, hoping at some point in the season he will be able to take his spot in the rotation.   New Rockies right-hander Zach Putnam has a multi-pitch arsenal with good movement on his fastball and the ability to induce ground balls with late sink. He has a bright future as a relief pitcher, likely profiling best as an eighth inning set-up man.   Putnam, 24, still has work to do on his secondary pitches, relying on his fastball to control at-bats at the moment. He progressed nicely through the Indians Minor League system, having pitched at Class A, Double-A and Triple-A levels.   Putnam tossed 7 1\/3 innings for the Indians in 2011, allowing five earned runs (6.14 ERA) with nine strikeouts and zero walks, following a 6-3 record and 3.65 ERA in 69 innings for Triple-A Columbus.   With roughly a month to go until pitchers and catchers report to camp, the Tigers and Indians both received news that significantly alter both their plans and on-field abilities. Spring Training will be a time to review their rosters and adjust accordingly. Bernie Pleskoff is a columnist for MLB.com.
