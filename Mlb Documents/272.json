    "body": "CINCINNATI -- A lifelong -- but disenchanted -- Reds fan tired of watching losing teams, businessman Robert Castellini finally decided to do something about it.  Two years ago, he didn't renew his luxury box at Great American Ball Park.  This week, Castellini officially became the majority owner of the oldest franchise in baseball. Instead of reporting to Allen, as he had done since becoming general manager in late 2003, Dan O'Brien will now report directly to the new owner.              Mark Sheldon is a reporter for MLB.com.
