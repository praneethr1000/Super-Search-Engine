    "body": "OAKLAND -- The A's have avoided arbitration with Eric Sogard, coming to terms on a one-year deal with the infielder on Friday. The deal is worth $1.075 million, according to CBS Sports. Sogard's camp had filed at $1.425 million, while the A's initially countered at $900,000. Thus the settlement comes in below the midpoint, but just above the $1 million figure projected by MLB Trade Rumors. Sogard, who will be 29 in May, is entering his sixth season in Oakland's organization. The A's have always lauded his superb defense at second base, where he started 80 games last year. He also appeared in 14 games at shortstop and is expected to see time at both positions this season in a backup role behind projected double-play partners Ben Zobrist and Marcus Semien. At the plate, Sogard hit .223\/.298\/.268 with 11 stolen bases in 329 plate appearances last season. His batting average fell in line with his career average of .235, but his .567 OPS was significantly lower than the .686 mark he posted in 2013. The A's have three remaining players eligible for arbitration: pitchers Fernando Abad, Tyler Clippard and Jarrod Parker. Jane Lee is a reporter for MLB.com.
