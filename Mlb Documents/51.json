    "body": "PHILADELPHIA -- Top prospect Cole Hamels heads the list of 18 non-roster players who have received invitations to Spring Training next month with hopes of making the Phillies' Major League squad. Ten pitchers, three catchers, three infielders and two outfielders will make the spring complex a busy place, along with 22 instructors to assist manager Charlie Manuel and his staff. Among those instructors is Hall of Fame third baseman Mike Schmidt, who returns for his sixth spring as a special hitting instructor, along with Garry Maddox and Ruben Amaro Sr. Hamels' inclusion brings excitement for those eager to see the talented lefty resume his career after being detoured by injuries. After a brilliant 2003 season that ended at Class A Clearwater, Hamels spent 2004 in big league camp. He impressed there by twice striking out Alex Rodriguez twice with his devastating changeup. Brian Sanches, RHP: As a reliever with Scranton\/Wilkes-Barre, Sanches went 5-3 with a 3.69 ERA in 51 games. The 27-year-old held left-handed hitters to a .212 average.
