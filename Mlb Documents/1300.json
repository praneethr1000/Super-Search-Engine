    "body": "The Red Sox avoided arbitration with catcher Jarrod Saltalamacchia on Thursday, signing him to a one-year, non-guaranteed contract for the 2013 season.  The 27-year-old hit .222 with 25 home runs and 59 RBIs last season, leading the Red Sox in homers and becoming the first catcher to do so since Carlton Fisk in 1973 and '77. Fisk hit 26 homers in both years, the club record for a catcher.  Saltalamacchia set career highs in home runs, RBIs, games (121), runs (55) and walks (38) last season. Nearly half (43) of his 90 hits were extra-base hits. He finished the season third among Major League catchers in homers and with the fourth-best slugging percentage (.454) among American League backstops. Defensively, Saltalamacchia's 104 games and 852 innings ranked fifth in the AL, and his 95 starts tied him for fifth.   Saltalamacchia was acquired from the Rangers in a 2010 non-waiver Trade Deadline deal, and he has hit 41 homers over the past two seasons.   Boston has eight arbitration-eligible players remaining: Alfredo Aceves, Andrew Bailey, Daniel Bard, Joel Hanrahan, Craig Breslow, Andrew Miller, Franklin Morales and Jacoby Ellsbury.
