    "body": "CLEVELAND -- Indians right-hander Joseph Colon has received a 50-game suspension without pay for violating the Minor League Drug Prevention and Treatment Program. Colon, who has tested positive twice for a drug of abuse, is currently in the fold for Cleveland as a non-roster invitee for Spring Training. The 25-year-old righty became a Minor League free agent this offseason, but re-signed with the Indians on Nov. 7 as a bullpen candidate. The Indians are currently weighing how the situation might impact Colon's status as a non-roster invitee this spring. The suspension will begin at the start of the regular season. Last season, which was Colon's first as a reliever, the pitcher turned in a 3.14 ERA with 47 strikeouts and 14 walks in 48 2\/3 innings (33 games) between stints with Double-A Akron and Triple-A Columbus. He had a 3.12 ERA in 12 appearances at Triple-A, lowering his career Minor League ERA to 3.50 through 124 appearances. Colon, who is currently a member of Triple-A Columbus' roster, was selected by the Indians in the 12th round of the 2009 First-Year Player Draft. Jordan Bastian is a reporter for MLB.com.
