    "body": "ST. LOUIS -- Few people know the stories of the St. Louis Cardinals like Brian Finch does. Now Finch gets to show off what he knows about the other 29 Major League teams as well.  Finch, the Cardinals' manager of stadium tours and museum outreach, is the club's representative for MLB Network's Baseball IQ game show, which begins on Tuesday. Each of the 30 teams, plus MLB.com and the Baseball Hall of Fame, is represented in the bracket contest, meaning that five rounds will narrow 32 contestants to a single champion of baseball trivia. The show runs into late February, offering a way to start getting in the mood for Spring Training.  In each episode, the winner earns $5,000 for the charity of the club he or she represents -- in Finch's case, Cardinals Care. The overall champion's charity will receive $25,000, and the runner-up's charity will be given $15,000. Finch was nominated by Vicki Bryant, the club's vice president for event services and merchandising. Each Cardinals VP nominated someone from his or her group, and the potential contestants took a trivia test. Finch scored the highest -- somewhat to his surprise -- and earned the trip to New York and the chance to compete.   \"I would never consider myself a trivia buff,\" Finch said. \"But I will say this: I work with our museum. So if there is somebody with a Cardinals perspective, we are charged with the responsibility of kind of continuing the legacy from a historical perspective and making sure the story is told accurately. ... [But] this is all Major League Baseball. You're around it, you get it, and there are certain milestones that are meaningless without the context of MLB in a greater capacity.\"   Adding to the fun of the trip was the opportunity to participate in a rivalry. The first round of matchups featured all of the game's biggest historic rivalries. The representatives from the Yankees and Red Sox faced off. The Giants and Dodgers went toe-to-toe. And so, of course, did the Cardinals and Cubs.   Not that it got nasty. Quite the opposite.   \"Off the field we're all on the same page,\" Finch said. \"On the field we're definitely rivals. ... [The Cubs' representative] was a good guy. It really made for some fun. We both had some fun with it.\"   Finch also notes that he made a point of sticking up for his city. Host Matt Vasgersian famously made some unflattering remarks about St. Louis a few years back, and Finch called him on it. He said that Vasgersian took it in very good humor and was entirely conciliatory.   But, of course, it was primarily about the competition, and Finch took it seriously. He's not letting on how it turned out, of course. Fans will have to tune in to see that. Matthew Leach is a reporter for MLB.com.
