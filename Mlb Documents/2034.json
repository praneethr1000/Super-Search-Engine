    "body": "CHICAGO -- The Cubs avoided arbitration with Felix Doubront, signing the left-handed pitcher to a one-year, $1.925 million contract on Thursday. Doubront was 2-1 with a 3.98 ERA in four starts with the Cubs, who acquired him from the Red Sox on July 30 for Minor League infielder Marco Hernandez. A candidate for the Cubs' rotation, Doubront was 2-4 with a 6.07 ERA in 17 games (10 starts) with Boston before the deal. The Cubs have six arbitration-eligible players remaining, including Travis Wood, Luis Valbuena, Pedro Strop, Chris Coghlan, Jake Arrieta and Welington Castillo. Hearings will take place from Feb. 1-21 if no settlement is reached before then. The deadline to exchange figures is Friday. Carrie Muskat is a reporter for MLB.com.
