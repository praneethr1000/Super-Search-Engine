It turns out that Hernandez's reach extended all the way to Japan.  \"I've seen him many times on television,\" new Mariners catcher Kenji Johjima said through translator Ken Barron during Sunday's FanFest at Safeco Field. \"I don't think I could hit him.\"  Fortunately for Johjima, he won't have to.
