    "body": "ARLINGTON -- Just like Mike Napoli, pitcher Derek Holland will likely have to wait for a long-term contract extension.  The Rangers had been discussing a potential five-year deal with Holland, but sources said Monday night that the talks have been tabled for now. The two sides were not close enough in the terms of the contract to continue the discussions.  Holland is still under the Rangers' control for four more years. He has this winter and three years of arbitration before he can be a free agent, but the Rangers have explored long-term contracts with their pre-arbitration players before. ",
