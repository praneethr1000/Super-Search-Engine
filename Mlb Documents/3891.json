    "body": "OAKLAND -- The A's trimmed their list of arbitration-eligible players to three on Wednesday, signing righty Justin Duchscherer to a one-year deal for the 2008 season.  Per club policy, financial details of the contract were not disclosed. Duchscherer, 30, made a reported $1.19 million in 2007; a raise came with the new deal, but it did not move the former All-Star setup man (2005) over the $2-million mark.  Limited to 17 appearances last season before he went on the disabled list with a strained right hip in mid-May, Duchscherer underwent hip surgery on July 11 and missed the rest of the year. He went 3-3 with a 4.96 ERA. A former starter in the Minor Leagues, Duchscherer has been used almost exclusively in relief during his five seasons with the A's. He hasn't started a Major League game since 2003, but Oakland will give him a chance to win a spot in the rotation this spring.   Fellow righties Joe Blanton, Chad Gaudin and Huston Street are now Oakland's only arbitration-eligible players unsigned. Mychael Urban is a national writer for MLB.com.
