    "body": "CHICAGO -- When the Cubs' marketing department first heard about MLB Network's new game show, \"Baseball IQ,\" many thought Wrigley Field organist Gary Pressy would be the perfect contestant.  Pressy, who has played at more than 2,000 Cubs home games, beginning on April 1, 1987, helps the marketing department by writing some of the in-game trivia questions for sponsors.  \"He's the guy -- he knows it all,\" Ryan Balogh said of Pressy. Instead, Balogh, 29, an account executive in the Cubs' marketing department, won an in-house competition. He will represent the team and square off in the first round of \"Baseball IQ\" against the Cardinals' Brian Finch, manager of Busch Stadium tours and museum.   It's Cubs vs. Cardinals once again.   \"Baseball IQ\" will premiere Tuesday at 8 p.m. CT. Hosted by MLB Network's Matt Vasgersian, the trivia show is 30 minutes and will feature two participants competing for a chance to win up to $45,000 for charity. Questions will cover all things baseball, from current players and managers to World Series champions, MVPs, Cy Young Award winners, Hall of Famers, milestones and more.   MLB Network surveyed all 30 clubs, MLB.com and the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum for their representatives. The bracket-style tournament will feature 32 participants, who range from front-office personnel to equipment managers to scoreboard operators.   The winning player of each episode will win $5,000 for the organization's charity they represent. The championship episode will award $25,000 for the winner's charity and $15,000 to the runner-up's charity.   Balogh grew up a Cubs fan in Wood Dale, Ill., and joined the team's marketing department in January 2008. He's spent at least one hour a day in preparation for the game show.   \"I'm using the same study method I did in college and high school,\" he said. \"I'll write something down three different ways. For example, take the list of [Most Valuable Players] every year, break it down by decade, break it down by position and break it down by team. If I do that, and write something down two or three times, it tends to stick with me longer, especially if it's interesting.\"   How did Balogh get the assignment? MLB Network contacted the Cubs' marketing department, and they created an in-house showdown. Twelve people competed, and the field was whittled down to Balogh vs. Lucas Luecke, the team's telecommunications and A\/V systems specialist.   The two competed in a format similar to what will be used on \"Baseball IQ,\" and Balogh won.   \"It's a lot of years of reading baseball cards,\" Balogh said.   The pressure is on to beat the Cardinals.   \"I've had some help,\" Balogh said of his prep work. \"[Assistant director of ticket sales] Brian Garza in the ticket office has given me random questions when I walk past him. Gary Pressy put together a couple trivia sheets on his own time and sent them to me, and I've sent back answers.\"   Balogh also knows he may not be able to show his face at Wrigley Field if he loses.   Jim Oboikowitch, a senior account executive in the marketing department who is 6-foot-7, hasn't helped with the topics but does remind Balogh of the importance of this contest.   \"I'm more afraid of the taunts than I am of anything else, so that's why you'll get 110 percent,\" Balogh said. \"I want to help the charity -- but I'm afraid of the taunts.\" Carrie Muskat is a reporter for MLB.com.
