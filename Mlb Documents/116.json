    "body": "NEW YORK -- It could either be the year of the reliever or the year of the big zero.  It could be the year that Bruce Sutter and Goose Gossage are anointed in the hallowed National Baseball Hall of Fame or nobody at all for the first time since 1996, when the Baseball Writers' Association of America failed to give any former player the requisite 75 percent of the vote.  The announcement will come Tuesday at 2 p.m. ET and be broadcast live on BaseballChannel.TV. Barry M. Bloom is a national reporter for MLB.com.
