    "body": "Baseball teams have always had to be creative, to the point of daring, in assembling their best possible lineups. That often means shuffling the talent already available to them.  Again this Spring Training, teams will engage in this risk, with a potentially huge payoff. Hanley Ramirez is setting out on the A-Rod Trail from short to third, Mark Trumbo also hopes to turn a hot corner, several relievers are transitioning to rotations.  The Marlins, the Angels and others thus will be continuing a tradition that reverts even further back than Babe Ruth -- that left-handed ace pitcher for the Red Sox who went to the Bronx and became immortal for something else.
