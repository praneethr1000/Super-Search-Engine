You don't get that anywhere else.\" On cue, the ostrich-riding, screaming crowd-pleaser burst through the door of the Reading Sheraton ballroom, tossing hot dogs and thrilling the 650 attending one of the tour's final stops. \"Good, I feel at home now,\" joked Manuel, who then delighted the crowd with his seldom-recited \"My Most Memorable Day,\" a poem he wrote.
