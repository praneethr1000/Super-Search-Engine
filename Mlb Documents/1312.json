    "body": "SAN FRANCISCO -- Giants third baseman Pablo Sandoval remained hospitalized Thursday in Venezuela with abdominal inflammation but was expected to be released in 24 to 48 hours. Manolo Hernandez-Douen, who writes the blog Beisbol Por Gotas, reported that the Navegantes del Magallanes, the Venezuelan Winter League team for which Sandoval has played part of the season, announced that the 26-year-old was hospitalized with stomach pains Wednesday. Doctors examined Sandoval and found no physical complications, said the ballclub, which also issued the estimated stretch of time regarding Sandoval's likely release from the hospital. Sandoval, who on Thursday was named to Venezuela's provisional roster for the 2013 World Baseball Classic, was expected to be in New York this weekend to pick up the Babe Ruth Award as last postseason's Most Valuable Player, as voted on by the New York chapter of the Baseball Writers' Association of America. But Sandoval's illness, as well as his possible participation in the round-robin, might prevent him from attending the Saturday night awards ceremony and dinner. Chris Haft is a reporter for MLB.com.
