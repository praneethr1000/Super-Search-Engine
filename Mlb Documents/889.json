    "body": "OAKLAND -- A's catcher Stephen Vogt underwent arthroscopic surgery on his right elbow Friday morning and is \"fully expected to be ready by Opening Day,\" the club stated in a release. Vogt's recovery time is estimated at 4-6 weeks, so it's likely the backstop will be limited in activity during the early part of Spring Training. A's pitchers and catchers are slated to report Feb. 20, with their first workout the following day. Dr. Jon Dickinson performed Vogt's surgery at Presidio Surgical Center in San Francisco, executing a debridement of the elbow joint and the removal of a bone chip. Last offseason, Vogt had foot surgery that also restricted his Spring Training activity, but he was catching again by the middle of March and was behind the plate on Opening Day. The 31-year-old enjoyed his first All-Star season in 2015, hitting .261 with 18 home runs and 71 RBIs in 136 games. He also led the A's with 56 walks and a .341 on-base percentage.
