    "body": "This is the type of week that baseball dreams are made of.  The next six days in the Dominican Republic could change the lives of several talented ballplayers from Latin America and dramatically impact the big league clubs looking to sign them.  Starting Wednesday, Major League Baseball will kick off a busy week for amateurs on the island with the second annual MLB Prospect League international showcase for players eligible to sign on July 2 in an event at Temistocles Metz Stadium in San Cristobal. On Friday, the International Prospect League (IPL) will bring together its league's best players for an All-Star game and showcase for two days at the Tampa Bay Rays' complex in Boca Chica. Also on Friday, the Dominican Prospect League (DPL) -- the first league of its kind on the island -- will open a four-day event called the Louisville Slugger Tournament Series for its top players at the New York Yankees' complex in Boca Chica.
