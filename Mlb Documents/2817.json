    "body": "The Pirates announced Tuesday that they have signed veteran infielder Robert Andino to a Minor League contract with an invitation to Spring Training. Andino, a career .232 hitter in 1,467 at-bats at the big league level, started last season with Seattle before being acquired by the Bucs in July. Andino primarily plays shortstop and second base, but he has also seen time at third base and in the outfield in the Major Leagues. The 29-year-old batted .184 in 29 games with the Mariners last season, and he hit .302 for Triple-A Indianapolis after being acquired by the Pirates on July 31. Andino, a former 22nd-round Draft pick, broke into the big leagues with the Marlins and was traded to the Orioles at the end of Spring Training in 2009. The Miami native batted .239 and played in 360 games over four years with the O's before being traded to Seattle in November 2012. The Pirates have invited 13 non-roster players to their Spring Training camp. Spencer Fordin is a reporter for MLB.com.
