    "body": "ATLANTA -- Jason Heyward, Kris Medlen and Jonny Venters are set to gain significant raises as they enter their first arbitration-eligible offseason.  Heyward, Medlen, Martin Prado, Eric O'Flaherty, Venters and Cristhian Martinez are the six Braves who have filed for salary arbitration. This procedural move puts them in position to have their respective salaries for the 2013 season determined either by further negotiations or an arbitrator's ruling.  All arbitration-eligible players and their respective teams will exchange figures by Friday, with each proposing a salary for 2013. Mark Bowman is a reporter for MLB.com.
