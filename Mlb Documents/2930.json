    "body": "MILWAUKEE -- The Brewers added more experience to their farm system Monday by signing 34-year-old utility man Pete Orr to a Minor League contract. Orr has played off the bench for the Braves, Nationals and Phillies, appearing in the Majors in eight of the last nine seasons. He spent most of 2013 with Philadelphia's Triple-A affiliate, hitting .258 in 95 games, but he also appeared in 13 big league games with the Phillies as a pinch-hitter, third baseman and left fielder. The veteran gives the Brewers utility depth, especially at second base. Orr's deal does not include an invitation to Major League Spring Training camp, but he was invited to the Brewers' early Minor League minicamp. Milwaukee now has a number of experienced infielders ticketed for Triple-A Nashville, including Orr, recently signed Joe Thurston and returning players like Eugenio Velez, Taylor Green and Stephen Parker. But Vinnie Catricala, a former top Mariners prospect acquired by Milwaukee from Oakland in the Minor League phase of last month's Rule 5 Draft, has opted to retire, Brewers assistant general manager Gord Ash said.
