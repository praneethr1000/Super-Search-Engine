    "body": "ARLINGTON -- At a time when they are drawing nearer to several contract negotiation deadlines, the Rangers planned to meet with free-agent pitcher Roy Oswalt and his agent, Bob Garber, on Monday, according to sources.  The meeting is considered exploratory. The Rangers have some interest in Oswalt, but they also have a set rotation that consists of Colby Lewis, Derek Holland, Yu Darvish, Matt Harrison and Neftali Feliz, and they also have Alexi Ogando and Scott Feldman in the bullpen.  Oswalt, who lives in Mississippi and has a long-standing relationship with club president Nolan Ryan, has expressed an interest in pitching for the Rangers. The Cardinals are also interested, and are high on Oswalt's list. General manager Jon Daniels acknowledged the club's interest in Oswalt but declined to discuss Monday's meeting.        T.R.
