    "body": "On the day before the deadline to file salary figures for potential arbitration cases, baseball gathered around the negotiating table rather than around the Hot Stove.  Sixteen more arbitration-eligible players reached contract agreements with their clubs on Monday, headlined by Dontrelle Willis' record deal with the Marlins.  As reported by MLB.com, Willis came to terms for $4.35 million, setting a new standard for a player in his first year with arbitration rights; right-hander Roy Halladay had held the record since 2003, when he signed with the Blue Jays for $3,825,000.
