    "body": "The Mets and second baseman Neil Walker agreed to a one-year contract to avoid arbitration, the team announced Friday. The deal is reportedly worth $10.55 million, according to MLB Network's Jon Heyman, just below the midpoint when the two sides exchanged salary figures. Walker, who is eligible to become a free agent after this season, asked for $11.8 million while the Mets countered with $9.4 million. â€¢ Hot Stove Tracker New York acquired Walker from Pittsburgh during the Winter Meetings in exchange for left-hander Jon Niese. Walker has averaged 142 games, 16 homers, a .269 average and a .765 OPS over the past five seasons and is expected to be the club's everyday second baseman in 2016. The deal leaves closer Jeurys Familia as the lone arbitration-eligible player yet to agree on a contract with the Mets. He requested $4.8 million and the team offered $3.3 million.
