    "body": "LOS ANGELES -- Dodgers right-handed reliever Blake Hawksworth will undergo arthroscopic surgery on his elbow Wednesday to remove a bone spur and scar tissue only five weeks before the opening of Spring Training, the club announced.  The Dodgers estimate a recovery time of four to six weeks, so Hawksworth might not be ready for the start of training camp.  The 28-year-old had a decent first season with the Dodgers after being acquired from the St. Louis Cardinals for Ryan Theriot. He went 3-5 with a 4.08 ERA in 49 appearances while making one trip to the disabled list with a strained groin muscle. Hawksworth served as a middle and long reliever for the Dodgers.   Because he is out of options, Hawksworth was considered likely to make the Opening Day roster.   Nonetheless, the Dodgers have a solid group of right-handed relievers ahead of him -- Javy Guerra, Kenley Jansen, Mike MacDougal, Matt Guerrier and Josh Lindblom.
