    "body": "BRADENTON, Fla. -- After spending months talking about increasing their presence in Latin America, the Pirates are making a substantial step in doing so by beginning work on a new training facility that will centralize the team's Latin American academy.  The organization announced on Thursday that it will be breaking ground on what will be the Pirates' new Latin American headquarters on January 22. The complex, which will span 43 acres, will be located in El Toro, Dominican Republic. The facility is expected to open sometime in 2009.  \"Latin America needs to be an even greater priority for our ballclub,\" Pirates owner Bob Nutting said. \"The Pirates have had a great history of Latino ballplayers making a significant impact at the Major League level, including the great Roberto Clemente. Today, no team has more opportunity or, frankly, a greater need to acquire and develop quality players from this region than we do.\" Nutting, then-CEO Kevin McClatchy and former general manager Dave Littlefield made a trip to the Dominican Republic last May to assess the resources being utilized and the state of the team's current facilities. What they found was an academy that was not up to the standards of those of other teams.   According to Rene Gayo, the Pittsburgh's director of Latin American scouting, only the Pirates and Orioles currently lack a centralized facility in Latin America. In other words, while the team did have a presence in the country, they hadn't been maximizing their resources.   Gayo cited inconvenience as one of the biggest problems in the past.   \"When you don't have a complex where everything is centralized, you are constantly having to bus people around,\" Gayo said. \"If they wanted to use weights, we had to bus them to the weight room. Homes had to be rented because we didn't have a place for players to stay.\"   All of these problems will be remedied by the construction of this new academy, which will hold all of the training facilities and will include dorms for the players.   \"I'm familiar with other facilities, and this will put us at the top of the list, where right now we are at the bottom,\" said Gayo, who is set to begin his fifth season with the organization. \"Having everything at one site makes it a lot easier because right now you can't get creative because you have to spend so much time busing players back and forth to different places.\"   Though new president Frank Coonelly and new GM Neal Huntington weren't on that initial visit to the Dominican Republic last spring, they have emphasized from Day 1 their belief that the Pirates need to improve their presence in Latin America in order to build a successful franchise.   Following in that mindset, the presence of this academy should not only increase the Pirates' presence in the Dominican Republic, but should also attract upcoming talent.   \"Once completed, this facility will have a significant and immediate impact on our scouting and player development operations in Latin America,\" Huntington said. \"This complex will provide us with an advantage in recruiting players, while providing an optimal setting to teach our young players not only baseball skills, but life skills.\"   Specific details regarding the construction of the complex will be announced in Pittsburgh on January 21, a day before the official groundbreaking ceremony.   Notes from minicamp:  A final group of pitchers -- Evan Meek, John VanBenschoten, Adam Bernero, Ty Taubenheim and Marino Salas -- threw seamless bullpen sessions at Pirate City on Thursday. ... Though he is still unable to participate in baseball-related activities, outfielder Chris Duffy was once again present on Thursday to take part in conditioning drills. ...
