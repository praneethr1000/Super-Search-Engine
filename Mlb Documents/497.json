    "body": "PHILADELPHIA -- Jimmy Rollins helped the Phillie Phanatic travel to Japan, Australia, Mexico and Holland on Thursday, and return in time for lunch. Such was the whirlwind morning for the Phanatic and Rollins at the latest stop of the Phillies Winter Tour Caravan. The duo stopped by the Isaac A. Sheppard School in Philadelphia to read \"The Phillie Phanatic's Phantastic Journey\" to an assembly of 300 first- through fourth-graders. The school was selected as one of the winners of the Phillies' Be a Phanatic About Reading Program, in which 73,000 students from 3,000 classrooms participated. The amount of time spent reading was chronicled -- at least 15 minutes a night and in some cases up to an hour -- and the Phanatic plans to visit the top 30 schools.
