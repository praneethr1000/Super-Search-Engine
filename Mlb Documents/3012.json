    "body": "PARADISE VALLEY, Ariz. -- Jeff Moorad is on the verge of completing his long-awaited purchase of the Padres, John Moores, the club's majority owner, told MLB.com. The 100 percent sale of the franchise -- at an estimated $530 million -- that Moores has held since late 1995 is on the agenda for approval by the owners at this Thursday's first joint quarterly meeting of the year. \"It's 100 percent done,\" Moores said in a phone conversation. \"I couldn't be more pleased. Jeff's remaining payment of all cash went into escrow in mid-December. I remain impressed that Jeff has done everything he said he would do.\" Barry M.
