    "body": "ANAHEIM -- Michael Young has a Dodgers offer on the table if he wants it, but with Spring Training now less than a month away, the 37-year-old infielder is still considering retirement. \"I'm going to take my time and make sure I go over my options, and do what's best for my family,\" Young said on Sunday. \"I've got three sons at home, and obviously they're my top priority. I would love to continue to play for a great team like the Dodgers. I mean, baseball's in my blood; good competition's in my blood. So I'd love to continue to do that. But at the same time, I want to do what's best for my family, for my boys.\" Mark Ellis, 36, was the Dodgers' everyday second baseman the previous two seasons but took a larger deal from the Cardinals, signing a one-year, $5.25 million contract with incentives in mid-December. With unproven 26-year-old Cuban infielder Alexander Guerrero -- signed to a four-year, $28 million contract in October -- slated to start at second base, the Dodgers could use a veteran utility guy like Young, who has plenty of experience at all four infield positions. Young, with 2,375 hits and a .300\/.346\/.441 career slash line, batted .276\/.336\/.395 as the Phillies' starting third baseman last season, then went 16-for-51 (.314) after being acquired by the Dodgers on Aug. 31. Ken Rosenthal of FOXSports.com reported on Jan. 14 that Young has \"decent offers\" from four teams. At this point, though, it seems like it's either the Dodgers -- a team that would give him a good chance to win his first World Series ring -- or retirement. \"I haven't been in any big hurry, but at the same time I want to be very respectful to the teams I'm talking with,\" Young said. \"Obviously, I can't say enough about my time with the Dodgers. I've made no secret about the fact that they rank at the top of my list. I loved my time with LA. Great time with the team, a first-class organization top to bottom; just an unbelievable experience to play for them.\" Young, who makes his offseason home in Dallas but still owns a home in Southern California, was joined on Sunday by several teammates he shared during that two-month run in Los Angeles, including Brian Wilson, Skip Schumaker, Nick Punto and Ellis -- the latter three infielders moving on to different teams. Young was partnering with former reliever and ex-Rangers teammate Eddie Guardado to host the third annual Stars & Strikes Celebrity Bowling Tournament at Bowlmor Lanes, an event that saw celebrities pair with foursomes to raise money and awareness for autism. Guardado's foundation focuses on the disorder, which has affected his daughter, Ava, while Young's is aimed towards improving the overall physical, social, mental and educational health of children. \"Eddie and I have always had that one thing in common, that we wanted to help out and lend a hand,\" Young said. \"My foundation is geared towards children's health, his is autism, so we felt like we were going to stick with autism on this one because it benefits both foundations.
