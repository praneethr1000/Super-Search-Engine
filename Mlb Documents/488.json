    "body": "CHICAGO -- Of the Chicago Cubs' last 12 No. 1 draft picks, Brooks Kieschnick, Kerry Wood, Jon Garland, Corey Patterson and Mark Prior have made it to the Major Leagues.  Tim Wilken's 11 first-round picks with the Toronto Blue Jays all have reached the big leagues.  Wilken is the new director of amateur and professional scouting for the Cubs. He most recently served as the special assistant to the general manager in Tampa Bay, where he also assisted in overseeing the scouting department. Wilken joined the Devil Rays in 2003. Prior to that, he had spent his entire career in the Toronto Blue Jays organization, serving as an area scout, Minor League coach and manager, national crosschecker, U.S. scouting director and vice president of baseball operations. During his 11 years after being promoted to national crosschecker of the Blue Jays, Toronto's draft was ranked in the top five each year and produced four Rawlings Gold Glove Award winners and two Cy Young Award winners. In 2005, 16 players who started in the Blue Jays organization were on the All-Star ballot and six were selected as All-Stars.   The Cubs plan to take advantage of Wilken's extensive background and have him involved in all forms of pro reporting. For example, Cubs general manager Jim Hendry will call upon Wilken to help assemble the 40-man roster, assess talent being considered in trades, and scout prospective players.   \"It's just kind of a hodgepodge thing that I did in Toronto and Tampa where I delved into a few different things,\" Wilken said, trying to describe his role. \"It's more to give Jim an idea of what's going on on the streets scouting-wise on both sides of the ledger.\"   Scouts are the silent partners who don't get much credit for the long hours, extensive days on the road, and zillions of reports that need to be filed.   \"The area [scouts] have quite the grind,\" Wilken said of the scouts who scour the country for amateur talent. \"They see anywhere from 400 to 600 games a year. They don't see all of a game, but they may see three or four in a day or more if there's a tournament. It gets kind of lost in the shuffle. I think [scouting] is done more for the genuine love of being in baseball.\"   Anyone can see a player hit line drives or throw fastballs. What's tough for scouts is to be able to get a read on the intangibles. What's the player's personality like? Is he a gamer? Is he a troublemaker? How committed is he to the game or is he just thinking about the potential dollars?   \"That's where the area guys are so important,\" Wilken said. \"They try to keep as much contact as they can with those kids. It is huge. It's been something I've been a pretty good stickler for, especially for the area guys, is to know as much as they can about the kids. Naturally, you can't always be right and you can be fooled. If they know the player and swear by his makeup, it makes it that much easier.\"   When draft day approaches in June, most scouting directors say they want to take the best player available. Wilken has a concept he's followed that has been successful.   \"There are some situations that dictate [you take the best player] but you can't always do that,\" he said. \"There might be a player who you say is the best player, but the guy's signability might have something to do with that. To say you're taking the best player is good in thought.\"   Wilken likes to target middle infielders because they're generally the best athletes available. Of course, that's only if it makes sense.   \"Going back to the 'best player' theory, I think you apply that in the early rounds, and as the draft drops off in ability and everything being somewhat equal, you start concentrating on your weaknesses,\" he said. \"If available, then naturally [look for] pitching -- especially left-handed pitching -- and shortstops and second basemen. [Middle infielders] generally have the ability to play somewhere else.\"   Wilken will meet with all of the Cubs scouts in Florida and then they'll scatter as spring baseball begins. When interviewed in mid January, he had already attended a showcase in Ft. Myers, Fla., which 200 kids attended. Wilken also wants to get a feel for what the Cubs already have in their Minor League system, and will work closely with player development director Oneri Fleita.   \"I know we're going to have to get better in the middle part of the diamond,\" Wilken said. \"With that in mind and if we get the pitching that we think we have and can add to that, it'll make this organization a lot stronger and give Jim and the Cubs a lot more resources if there are deals that have to be made.\"   One other area that Wilken wants to explore is the possibility of adding more international talent. The World Baseball Classic in March will be a good showcase. Wilken will have scouts at those games to try and gauge the quality of players.   Scouts learn how to deal with being on the road constantly. Wilken says he's finally found a good suitcase. He used to buy Samsonite, but that would barely last two years. Now, he's moved up to a Tumi bag with a lifetime guarantee that's lasted five years.   \"Now learning how to pack is the other accomplishment,\" Wilken said.   After nearly 30 years on the road, he'll get that right some day. Carrie Muskat is a reporter for MLB.com. This story was not subject to the approval of Major League Baseball or its clubs.",
