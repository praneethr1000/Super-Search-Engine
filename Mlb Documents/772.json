    "body": "Tuesday brought news of a pair of front-office executives on the move, and there were also plenty of free-agent rumblings on the rumor mill. Here's a look at the latest Hot Stove stories floating around the Major Leagues. Maeda deal slowed by health concerns The Dodgers' reported deal with Japanese right-hander Kenta Maeda is taking longer than expected because of concerns over his elbow, though the pact is expected to become official in the next 48 hours, according to ESPN's Jerry Crasnick. â€¢ Hot Stove Tracker Maeda's agreement includes a $25 million guarantee and undisclosed performance bonuses over the eight-year deal, according to the New York Post. Maeda was posted by the Hiroshima Carp, who will receive a posting fee from the Dodgers that could reach a maximum of $20 million. Latest on Chris Davis, Alex Gordon  The Orioles' offer to slugger Davis remains at seven years and $154 million and club CEO Peter Angelos has yet to approve a \"full-bore pursuit\" of top outfield free agents Gordon, Yoenis Cespedes and Justin Upton, according to MLB Network's Jon Heyman. The Royals, meanwhile, would like to re-sign Gordon despite a slow beginning to contract discussions and are also showing interest in other outfielders, including Dexter Fowler, Gerardo Parra and Denard Span, per Heyman. Braves could bring back Johnson The Braves and versatile infielder Kelly Johnson have remained in close contact about a potential reunion in Atlanta, MLB.com's Mark Bowman reports. A deal could come sooner rather than later, as there's a greater than 50 percent chance the Braves end up signing Johnson, according to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. The Braves need infield depth and Johnson could help, particularly at third base. The 10-year veteran has a lifetime .251 average and produced a .256\/.314\/.435 slash line in 2015 with the Braves and Mets. Mets, O's in talks with Antonio Bastardo  The Mets and Orioles are both in need of bullpen help, and they are among the teams in discussions for left-hander Bastardo, according to ESPN's Buster Olney. However, the Mets' interest seems to be limited. According to the New York Post, they won't give Bastardo a three-year contract, which is the length of deal he is said to be seeking. It's more likely the Mets will add a right-hander on a one-year deal or fill out their 'pen with Minor League signings, reports MLB.com's Anthony DiComo, who mentions Tyler Clippard as a possibility. Bastardo, 30, had a 2.98 ERA last season as a key member of a strong Pirates bullpen. Nationals talking trade? The Nationals have examined the trade market for catchers and are \"involved in a number of fronts,\" according to Heyman. It's not clear whom the Nationals are targeting. They have four catchers on the 40-man roster in Jose Lobaton, Wilson Ramos, Pedro Severino and Spencer Kieboom. Uggla garnering interest There appears to be a small demand for second baseman Dan Uggla, as he is reportedly in talks with multiple teams, according to SB Nation. It's unclear which clubs have made contact, but all are said to be looking for infield depth. Uggla, 35, spent all of last season with the Nationals, appearing in 67 games and hitting .183 with two home runs. Austin Laymance is a reporter for MLB.com.
