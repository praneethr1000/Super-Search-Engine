    "body": "SAN DIEGO -- The Padres announced on Thursday that FanFest presented by State Farm will return to Petco Park on Feb. 9.  The daylong event is free and open to the public. Details surrounding Padres FanFest will be released before the event.  Last year, the Padres had nearly 18,000 attend the one-day event with more than 20 players attending, along with manager Bud Black. Third baseman Chase Headley presided over a hitting clinic while Clayton Richard did the same for a pitching clinic on the field.   One change that occurred last year was moving the Padres Garage Sale to the actual field itself, where merchandise -- such as autographed jerseys, game-used equipment and clubhouse memorabilia -- was sold, raising more than $80,000 to benefit the Padres Foundation.   The team also announced that it will hold its annual awards dinner on Feb. 8 at the San Diego Hall of Champions in Balboa Park, where it was previously held before moving to Petco Park in 2012.   The event -- which will include a reception and dinner, Padres players, coaches, broadcasters and members of the leadership team -- will help kick off the 2013 season and honor the Padres' 2012 Major League and Minor League award winners.   Individual tickets and tables for the dinner are on sale now, with all proceeds benefiting the San Diego Hall of Champions' Jr. Reviving Baseball in Inner Cities (RBI) program in San Diego.   For information, or to purchase tickets, please contact the Padres community relations department via email at community@padres.com or by phone at 619-795-5274. Corey Brock is a reporter for MLB.com.
