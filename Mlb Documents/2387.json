    "subtitle": "",
    "body": "The Nationals agreed to terms on a Minor League contract with outfielder Derrick Robinson on Friday, though the deal does not include an invitation to big league Spring Training. Robinson, 27, reached the Majors with the Reds in 2013, playing in 102 games and spending time at all three outfield positions. The switch-hitter batted .255\/.322\/.323 over 216 plate appearances, with seven doubles, three triples and eight RBIs. He stole four bases in nine attempts. Robinson didn't play last season after having surgery on his left shoulder. A fourth-round pick by the Royals in the 2006 First-Year Player Draft, Robinson is a .254 hitter over eight Minor League seasons, with only 13 home runs but 317 stolen bases. He's stolen at least 50 bases four times. Andrew Simon is a reporter for MLB.com. Follow him on Twitter @AndrewSimonMLB.
