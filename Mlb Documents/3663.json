    "body": "PHILADELPHIA -- The Phillies added some pitching depth by agreeing to a Minor League contract with right-hander Joel Pineiro. The team announced the signing on Tuesday.  Pineiro received an invitation to Spring Training, which opens next month in Clearwater, Fla.  The 33-year-old went 7-7 with a 5.13 ERA in 27 appearances (24 starts) with the Angels last season. He will give the Phillies another veteran arm in camp, and some insurance for a projected rotation that includes Roy Halladay, Cliff Lee, Cole Hamels, Joe Blanton and Vance Worley. Pineiro tied for the ninth-most ground-ball double plays -- 23 -- among American League starting pitchers last season.   Before his time with the Angels, the veteran righty pitched for the Mariners, Red Sox and Cardinals. He is 104-93 with a 4.41 ERA in 335 career Major League games, 263 of them starts.
