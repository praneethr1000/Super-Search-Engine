    "body": "CLEVELAND -- Ken Schnacke, president and general manager of the Triple-A Columbus Clippers, knows his club's role in the big picture. \"Our job is to be the perfect little brother,\" Schnacke said. \"We take a lot of pride in that.\" The Clippers, of course, have a new big brother this season, as the Indians are moving their Triple-A operations from Buffalo -- their affiliate of the past 14 years -- to Ohio's state capital. It's a move that has generated enthusiasm not just in the Tribe's front office, but also in the city of Columbus. Anthony Castrovince is a reporter for MLB.com.
