    "body": "BRADENTON, Fla. -- Pirates second baseman Jose Castillo made his first appearance at minicamp on Friday with a distinctly different look, and a commitment to make his season-ending knee injury just a distant memory.  Castillo, who has chopped his bushy locks down to a neatly trimmed coif, spent the offseason rehabbing a complete tear of the MCL in his left knee. He believes that the hours of running, lifting weightings, batting practice and fielding drills have paid off.  \"There's no pain or anything,\" said Castillo, who fielded grounders and participated in batting practice during the workout on Friday. \"I'm working hard this year to be the starting second baseman and [improve] my hitting.\" Ed Eagle is a reporter for MLB.com.
