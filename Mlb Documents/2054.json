    "body": "A flurry of signings occurred throughout Major League Baseball on Friday, as clubs and players came to agreements on the final day to exchange salary numbers for the 2015 season. The two sides can continue negotiating until a potential hearing, which would take place in February. A player with three years of service, but less than six, is eligible to file for arbitration. A player with two years of service can be classified as a Super Two and also is eligible for arbitration if he accumulated at least 86 days of service in 2014 and ranks in the top 22 percent in service among players with two to three years of service. Friday's biggest deal was the Tigers and left-hander David Price agreeing to a one-year, $19.75 million pact. Price's contract eclipsed Max Scherzer's $15.25 million salary last year for the largest one-year deal for an arbitration-eligible player. Baltimore and right-hander Chris Tillman agreed to a one-year, $4.315 million deal, the second-highest all-time for a first-time arbitration-eligible starter, behind Price in 2012 ($4.35 million).
