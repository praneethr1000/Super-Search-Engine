    "body": "PHOENIX -- And then there were four.  The Diamondbacks on Friday avoided salary arbitration with pitcher Luis Vizcaino when the two sides agreed on a one-year, $1,775,000 deal.  A baseball source also said that Arizona reached an agreement with catcher Johnny Estrada on a one-year, $2 million contract, though the Diamondbacks declined to comment. The signings leave the Diamondbacks with second baseman Orlando Hudson, infielder Alex Cintron, and pitchers Claudio Vargas and Brandon Lyon still eligible for salary arbitration.   Tuesday is the day that teams and players exchange salary arbitration figures, and Arizona general manager Josh Byrnes said that it acts almost as a deadline for the two sides to reach an agreement.   \"I think more than half will get knocked out between now and Tuesday,\" Byrnes said referring to all team's cases, not the D-Backs specifically.   Estrada came to the Diamondbacks during the Winter Meetings in a deal that saw Oscar Villarreal and Lance Cormier go to the Braves.   Estrada was limited to 105 games last season after being involved in a collision at home plate with the Angels' Darin Erstad on June 6. His best year came in 2004 when he hit .314 with 36 doubles, nine homers and 76 RBIs, and appeared in the All-Star Game.   Vizcaino was acquired by the Diamondbacks from the White Sox in the trade that sent Javier Vazquez to Chicago. The right-hander appeared in 65 games last year for the Sox, going 6-5 with a 3.73 ERA in 70 innings. In 33 of his 65 games, he threw more than one inning, and his 289 appearances since the start of the 2002 season are the sixth-most in the big leagues during that period.
