    "body": "MINNEAPOLIS -- The Twins took care of their first arbitration-eligible player on Saturday by agreeing to terms with Michael Cuddyer on a one-year deal worth around $1.3 million.  The deal allows the team to avoid the arbitration process with Cuddyer and comes just four days after the two sides had swapped salary figures. Cuddyer was seeking $1.5 million and the Twins had offered $1.1 million. Finding a deal that satisfied both sides without having to go through the rigors of a hearing was something that pleased both Cuddyer and Twins general manager Terry Ryan.  \"It's nice to have the deal done and be able to focus on Spring Training,\" Cuddyer said. \"We felt like we had a strong case and the Twins also felt that way, so it's great that we could get a settlement where both of us were happy with the result.\" A utility infielder for the club last season, Punto made $325,000 while appearing in 112 games and hitting .239. Punto is expected to compete for the starting shortstop job this season along with Jason Bartlett. He is seeking $850,000, and the Twins have offered $625,000.
