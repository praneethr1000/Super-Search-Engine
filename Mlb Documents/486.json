After a week of false starts and tweaks, Philadelphia may have finally acquired Cleveland reliever Arthur Rhodes for outfielder Jason Michaels. Rhodes, 36, took a physical on Friday in Philadelphia, a team source said, which should complete the Phillies' portion of a larger deal that might lead to Coco Crisp's long-awaited arrival in Boston. The source cautioned that Rhodes isn't the final hurdle, which might delay the announcement. Ken Mandel is a reporter for MLB.com.
