    "body": "CHICAGO -- Saturday's SoxFest Town Hall Meeting featured manager Robin Ventura, bench coach Mark Parent, pitching coach Don Cooper and hitting coach Jeff Manto taking questions at a crowded Red Lacquer Room in the Palmer House Hilton. Ken 'Hawk' Harrelson served as the moderator, with a number of highlights coming from the 45-minute session.  One in particular was Ventura being asked how he would handle potentially benching a struggling veteran, even if he has a big salary. The manager responded that \"We'll invite him to sit on the bench,\" earning a huge ovation from the crowd.  \"My belief is I'm not going to treat everybody the same, but I'm going to treat everyone fairly,\" Ventura said. \"Paul Konerko is going to get treated differently than a rookie that just got called up. That's just the way it is. That's the way it's going to operate with me. \"If a guy needs to get a few days off, he's going to get a few days. If he needs the whole season, he'll get the whole season.\"",
