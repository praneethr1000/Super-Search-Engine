    "body": "ATLANTA -- Tom Glavine will officially rejoin the Braves when pitchers and catchers report to Spring Training in six weeks. This long offseason, which was highlighted with his return, will soon come to a close.  Fans wanting to get an early look at the 2008 Braves will have their first opportunity to purchase tickets for the exhibition season at braves.com on Saturday at 10 a.m. ET.  The Braves released their 33-game exhibition-game schedule on Friday, which includes a two-game set that will be held at Turner Field on March 28-29 against the defending American League Central champion Indians. For the 11th consecutive season, the Braves will train at Disney's Wide World of Sports Complex in Lake Buena Vista, Fla. They'll open their exhibition season at the newly named Champion Stadium on Feb. 27 against the University of Georgia.   The Grapefruit League season will begin the following day, when the Braves make their only scheduled trip to Vero Beach, Fla., to face the Dodgers, who will end a 60-year affiliation with the beach town when they move their Spring Training headquarters to Arizona in 2009.   The Braves will then welcome the Dodgers, who now employ Andruw Jones as their center fielder, to Champion Stadium for their home opener on Feb. 29. After making the short drive to face the Astros in Kissimmee, Fla., on March 1, the Braves will return to Disney the following day to face the Astros.   Both the Indians and Astros appear on this year's exhibition-season schedule six times. The Braves will also face both the Cardinals and Tigers four times. There are also three games scheduled against the Mets and two against the Phillies.   The Phillies, who unseated the Mets as National League East champs in 2007, will visit Disney on March 4 and host the Braves in Clearwater, Fla., on the 14th.   The Braves will close the Florida portion of their exhibition schedule on March 27 with a home game against the Mets, who will serve as the hosts in the matchup of these division rivals in Port St. Lucie, Fla., on March 3 and 25.   Once again, the Braves and Cardinals will stage two-game series against each other in the middle of the month. They'll play a two-game set on March 9-10 at Disney and on March 16-17 in Jupiter, Fla.   The Braves will host three night games at Champion Stadium, with each of them scheduled to begin at 7:05 p.m. ET. These games will be played on March 11 (Nationals), March 12 (Indians) and March 20 (Tigers).   Before heading to Washington to begin the regular season against the Nationals in front of a national Sunday Night Baseball audience on ESPN on March 30, the Braves will host the Indians for a two-game series at Turner Field. The teams will play at 7:05 p.m. ET on March 28, and then close out their exhibition seasons the next day with a 1:05 p.m. start.   Glavine, who previously played in Atlanta from 1987-2002, and Mike Hampton, who has missed the past two seasons while recovering from separate left elbow surgical procedures, will gain attention during Spring Training. The most compelling position contest will be staged between Jordan Schafer and Josh Anderson, who will battle to serve as Jones' replacement in center field.   Braves pitchers and catchers will report to camp on Feb. 14, and the first full-squad workout is scheduled for the 20th.   Tickets to the home games that will be held in Florida can also be purchased at the Disney Wide World of Sports box office. The Turner Field box office will also be selling tickets for the March 28-29 games against the Indians.    Mark Bowman is a reporter for MLB.com.
