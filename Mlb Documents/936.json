    "body": "ARLINGTON -- The Rangers have re-signed pitcher Nick Tepesch to a Minor League contract with an invitation to Spring Training. The right-hander was non-tendered back in November. Tepesch missed the 2015 season because of surgery to correct Thoracic Outlet Syndrome, but he's throwing off a mound and is expected to be ready for Spring Training. He will compete for the fifth spot in the rotation along with Nick Martinez, Chi Chi Gonzalez, Anthony Ranaudo and A.J. Griffin. â€¢ Hot Stove Tracker Tepesch made 39 starts and three relief appearances for the Rangers in 2013-14, going 9-17 with a 4.56 ERA and a 1.37 WHIP. He was a 14th-round pick in the 2010 Draft from the University of Missouri. Saab named director of international scouting The Rangers have promoted Rafic Saab to director of international scouting.
