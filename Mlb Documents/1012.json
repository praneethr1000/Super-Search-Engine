    "body": "SEATTLE -- Franklin Gutierrez has missed more games than he's played over the past two seasons, so the questions are inevitable.  Is he finally healthy? How's he feeling? Can he stay in one piece and solidify the Mariners outfield and provide a quality right-handed bat to what should be an improved offense in 2013?  Ultimately, Gutierrez can only answer those questions by performing on the field. But as he heads toward Spring Training in just under two weeks, the 2010 Gold Glove center fielder is doing his best to assure everyone that he's ready to play after a strong December in the Venezuelan Winter League.
