    "body": "ARLINGTON -- Eleven years ago, the Rangers held another big press conference at the Ballpark in Arlington to introduce a superstar into their organization. That was Alex Rodriguez, and the Rangers had just signed him to the largest contract in team sports history.  That didn't turn out too well. Rodriguez, after signing his 10-year, $252 million contract, spent just three frustrating season with the Rangers. He put up spectacular offensive numbers but the Rangers still finished in last place three straight times before Rodriguez was traded to the Yankees.  On Friday night, the Rangers held another mega-press conference to introduce Japanese pitcher Yu Darvish. General manager Jon Daniels said the circumstances surrounding Darvish are completely different than when the Rangers signed Rodriguez in 2000. T.R. Sullivan is a reporter for MLB.com.
