    "body": "TORONTO -- The Blue Jays claimed left-hander Tommy Hottovy off waivers from the Rangers on Thursday afternoon.  The 31-year-old appeared in nine games for the Royals last season while posting a 2.89 ERA in 9 1\/3 innings. He spent the vast majority of the year pitching for Triple-A Omaha of the Pacific Coast League, where he recorded a 2.52 ERA with seven saves in 50 innings of work.  Hottovy was designated for assignment by Kansas City at the end of the year before joining the Rangers. The former fourth-round pick in the 2004 First-Year Player Draft has appeared in 17 games during his Major League career. To make room on the 40-man active roster, the Blue Jays designated right-hander Chad Beck for assignment. It's the second time this offseason that Toronto has removed Beck from its 40-man roster. Beck was previously placed on waivers and claimed by the Pirates. Gregor Chisholm is a reporter for MLB.com. Read his blog, North of the Border, and follow him on Twitter @gregorMLB.
