    "body": "DETROIT -- Ron Wade does not consider himself a trivia buff. He'll hang out with friends once in a while and do trivia contests, but he isn't a ringer.  As a Detroit native and former Tigers season-ticket holder who now works for his childhood team as marketing director, Wade knows the game and its history, but didn't consider himself a baseball trivia expert. He knew plenty about the Tigers, and he has a pretty good memory of opposing players he used to watch at Tiger Stadium, but he didn't read up on tidbits or anything.  \"When I think of a trivia buff, I think of Ken Jennings on 'Jeopardy,'\" Wade said, referring to the 74-time game show winner. When Wade stepped onto the stage at MLB Network studios and saw the bright lights, however, he was that guy. As part of the network's new game show, \"Baseball IQ,\" Wade not only was competing for glory, he was representing his club, the team he grew up following.   He was also learning that competing on a game show is vastly different than trying his hand at trivia. It's not just what you know, but how quickly you can think of it under pressure.   \"Nothing prepares you for actually being there on the stage with the bright lights, knowing you have a couple seconds to get the answer correct,\" Wade said. \"I mean, you can prepare all you want.\"   And nothing compared to the silent stress of trying to think through a question he didn't immediately know the answer to. With no studio audience, but plenty of eyes trained on him, he had a new appreciation for pressure situations.   Wade can't say how he fared on the show. Fans will have to tune into MLB Network on Feb. 7 at 9 p.m. ET to find out how well he competed against White Sox baseball operations director Dan Fabian in a divisional clash. But he promises it'll be good television.   The winner of each episode earns $5,000 for the charity of the team's choice. In Wade's case, he competed for the Detroit Tigers Foundation, whose efforts to help develop and fund innovative programs for youth, education and recreation include field renovations and assistance to area youth leagues.   Wade's path to the show began with an email around Tigers offices inviting anyone to compete to decide who would represent the club on the network, which began taping \"Baseball IQ\" earlier this month. A written test gave him an idea what he was up against.   It wasn't a typical trivia contest.   \"Not at all,\" Wade said. \"I think quite a few people, when we saw the questions, were thinking, 'Wow, these are difficult.' And when you think about it, there's 150 years of baseball to draw on.\"   And they used a lot of that history to their advantage in toughening up the contest. Those who made the cut had an in-person test to add a little pressure to it.   At some point in the office, Wade figured, he'd run up against somebody with much more background on baseball history, maybe somebody from the media relations department who has to put together media guides and game notes every year, or a historian. But Wade did a lot better than hold his own.   That's when the real fun began. Once Wade won the Tigers' in-house competition, he had to become that trivia buff. He was no longer competing in a friendly contest. He was going on television, where everybody could second-guess him just as easily as they could cheer him. And if he lost out on a question about the Tigers, he could only imagine what he'd hear when he got home.   \"Especially when I started to study, I realized there's a lot to tackle,\" he said. \"You start to think, 'They could ask me anything about baseball over 150 years.' It was fun, a lot of fun, but it was stressful.\"   It was also too much to try to study everything, every era, every award. For those unanticipated questions, those times he might draw a blank, Wade would need a good enough background to formulate a reasonable guess.   \"Tigers.com and baseball-reference.com and MLB.com became my friends for a couple weeks,\" he said. \"I tried to compartmentalize.\"   The cramming paid off, he said. Still, while he can't give away the show results, he admits there was \"guesswork\" that came into play on a couple of questions.   That process, maybe as much as the questions, was where the pressure weighed.   \"You can almost hear the hard drive in your head whirring,\" Wade joked.   As for the rest, well, you'll have to watch to find out.   \"I think that when people tune in it's going to be good TV,\" he said. \"I think people will play along. You're going to watch and you're going to sit and you're going to yell at the TV screen and play along at home, which I think makes for good TV.   \"It was a great experience, a lot of fun. I can't wait to tune in myself.\" Jason Beck is a reporter for MLB.com. Read Beck's Blog and follow him on Twitter @beckjason.
