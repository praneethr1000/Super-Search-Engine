    "body": "DENVER -- When the Rockies arrive in Scottsdale, Ariz., for Spring Training, they'll see what look like several doormats in their spacious and modern exercise room. Well, they're much more. They're state-of-the-art tools that the Rockies hope will help them rise from the floor of the National League West and into playoff contention in 2013. On Tuesday, the club and Sparta Performance Science, a Silicon Valley sports performance company, announced an agreement that will make the Rockies the first professional sports team to install force-plate technology and proprietary software as part of the strength-and-conditioning equipment. The new equipment might not look like a big deal, but it will provide a startling amount of data that the Rockies believe could hold a key to helping the club figure out how to improve performance and prevent injury. Some of the injuries were difficult to explain, such as pitcher Jhoulys Chacin's nerve issue in his chest, third baseman Chris Nelson's irregular heartbeat and infielder Jonathan Herrera's missed time because of an infection from his wrist watch.
