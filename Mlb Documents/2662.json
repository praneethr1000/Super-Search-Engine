    "body": "Nationals outfielder Jayson Werth has been sentenced to five days in jail in Fairfax, Va., after pleading guilty to reckless driving. On Dec. 5, Werth was convicted of driving 105 mph in a 55 mph zone on the Capital Parkway on July 6. He was originally sentenced to 10 days in jail but appealed. The charge was reduced Thursday when he entered a guilty plea. Werth will serve his sentence on weekends to allow him to continue rehabbing his right shoulder, which underwent arthroscopic surgery on Jan. 9. His recovery is expected to take two to three months. Werth will also lose his driver's license for six months. \"We are aware of the agreement reached today,\" the Nationals said in a statement. \"It is clear that Jayson has taken this matter seriously and with great personal reflection. We do not condone reckless behavior, and we expect all members of the Washington Nationals organization to act in a responsible manner. We support Jayson, who is an integral part of the community and of the Washington Nationals family.\" Paul Hagen is a reporter for MLB.com.
