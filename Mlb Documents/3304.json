    "body": "Former University of Wisconsin quarterback Russell Wilson has decided to pursue a career on the gridiron rather than the diamond, according to ESPN.com. The two-sport athlete and Rockies prospect has informed Colorado that he will not report to Spring Training.  Wilson, the 140th overall pick in the 2010 First-Year Player Draft, appeared in 61 games in 2011 with the Asheville Tourists, the Rockies' Class A affiliate, hitting .228 with three home runs, 15 RBIs and 15 stolen bases as a second baseman. Wilson debuted in the Rockies' system in 2010, when he hit .230 with two home runs and 11 RBIs with Tri-City of the Northwest League.  \"I want to put all my focus in football and see where it takes me,\" Wilson told Pete Thamel of the New York Times. Wilson followed up his Minor League performance by spearheading Wisconsin to the 2011 Big Ten championship and an appearance in the 2012 Rose Bowl, throwing for 3,175 yards, 33 touchdowns and four interceptions this past season. Wilson transferred to Wisconsin after playing three years at North Carolina State, where he hit .306 with three home runs and 12 RBIs in 2010, his final season at the school.
