    "body": "PARADISE VALLEY, Ariz. -- Commissioner Bud Selig's two-year contract extension through the 2014 season was approved on Thursday by Major League Baseball's ownership at their first joint quarterly meeting of the year.  \"I've often said in my life that there's no higher honor than being the Commissioner of baseball,\" Selig told reporters after the conclusion of the meeting. \"You have no idea how sensitive I am to the institution, to the job and frankly to my personal responsibilities. I understand that all too well.  \"I am very humbled by the request to stay on, and I look forward to building on the great momentum our game has seen in recent years.\" As part of the latest labor agreement, the Astros will move from the NL to the AL prior to the 2013 season. Also, MLB will add two more Wild Card teams, making for two in each league that will play a one-game playoff to advance in the postseason.    Barry M.
