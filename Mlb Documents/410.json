    "body": "SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. -- Mediation has begun between Major League Baseball and the District of Columbia regarding construction of a downtown ballpark for the Washington Nationals, MLB's No. 2 official said on Wednesday night.  \"The process has started,\" said Bob DuPuy, MLB's president and chief operating officer. \"We're required not to comment on the substance of it by contract.\"  The step was necessitated because the D.C. City Council failed to meet a contractual end-of-the-year deadline to sign a lease with MLB, plus secure a site and financing for the ballpark, which was originally pegged at $535 million. Mediation prefaces full-blown arbitration to resolve the matter. Barry M. Bloom is a national reporter for MLB.com. This story was not subject to the approval of Major League Baseball or its clubs.",
