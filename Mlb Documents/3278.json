    "body": "Veteran right-handed reliever Scott Proctor is headed to South Korea after inking a one-year, $300,000 deal to play for the Doosan Bears, according to The Associated Press.  The 35-year-old finished his 2011 campaign with the Yankees after being released by the Braves in August. He compiled a combined 2-6 record and 7.14 ERA in 39 appearances.  Proctor was originally selected in the 17th round of the 1995 First-Year Player Draft by the Mets but decided to attend Florida State. He made his Major League debut for the Yankees in 2004 and became a fixture in Joe Torre's bullpen over the next three-plus seasons. Proctor pitched for the Yankees in the American League Division Series in 2005 and 2006. He made a career-high 83 appearances in 2006 and equaled that number in 2007.   After struggling during June 2007, Proctor drew attention for burning his equipment outside of the dugout on the field at Yankee Stadium after a loss to the A's. He was dealt to the Dodgers for third baseman Wilson Betemit at the July 31 Trade Deadline that year.   Proctor made 41 appearances for the Torre-managed Dodgers in 2008 and inked a deal with the Marlins in 2009, but didn't pitch in the Majors that year. He signed with the Braves in November 2009 and made six appearances in 2010 and 31 in 2011 before being released. He returned to the Yankees in August but struggled, posting a 0-3 record with a 9.00 ERA in eight appearances.   Proctor compiled an 18-16 record and one save with a 4.78 ERA in 307 appearances in parts of seven Major League seasons.    Matt Weber is a reporter for MLB.com.
