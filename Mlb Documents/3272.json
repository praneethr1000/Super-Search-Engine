    "body": "MILWAUKEE -- Brewers first baseman-to-be Mat Gamel says he is working hard this winter to get in shape for the most important Spring Training of his baseball life.  Gamel told The Sporting News this week that he dropped a few pounds by cutting out fast food and has rededicated himself to the weight room. That will come as good news to Milwaukee manager Ron Roenicke, who said this about Gamel earlier this winter, after it became clear the Brewers wouldn't be players for free-agent first baseman Prince Fielder:  \"Hopefully he comes to camp ready and in good shape,\" Roenicke said. \"If Prince doesn't re-sign, [Gamel] deserves to get a shot at first base.\" \"We're just moving through the process,\" Boras said Wednesday night at the Owners Meetings in Phoenix. \"It's just one that takes some time. You've got to meet with owners. You've got to sit down and talk with them about their needs. He needs to know where they're headed. He's going to be there a long time, wherever he's going. So we need to get that information to him and evaluate it.\"   Adam McCalvy is a reporter for MLB.com. Read his blog, Brew Beat, and follow him on Twitter at @AdamMcCalvy.
