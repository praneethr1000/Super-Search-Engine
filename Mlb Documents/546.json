    "body": "The Cubs finalized one long-discussed deal on Friday and reportedly were talking with an old friend about another.  First, the done deal. The Cubs finalized a one-year contract with veteran backup catcher Paul Bako, who previously played for the team in 2003-2004. Bako will get a salary in the neighborhood of $500,000, according to multiple reports over the past few weeks, to serve as the backup to reigning National League Rookie of the year Geovany Soto.  Bako, 36, a defensive-minded catcher, hit .217 in 99 games for the Reds last season and bats left-handed. Soto is a right-handed hitter. Bako has thrown out 28.2 percent of attempted basestealers in his career, including a 26.7-percent success rate last season with the Reds, and he has a .990 career fielding percentage behind the plate.
