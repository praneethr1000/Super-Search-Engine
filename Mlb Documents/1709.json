    "body": "Yankees shortstop Derek Jeter worked out on a baseball field on Monday for the first time since breaking his left ankle in the 2012 American League Championship Series.  The 38-year-old Jeter took 55 ground balls at New York's Minor League complex in Tampa, Fla., according to a report in The Associated Press, and he also hit in the batting cage.  \"Everything went well,\" Jeter told the AP. Jeter told reporters earlier in January that he had been cleared to begin baseball activities no later in the offseason than he normally would. He was out of his walking boot shortly after Christmas and was walking without any visible limp at his annual golf outing on Jan. 16 in Tampa.   Asked whether he'd be able to start on Opening Day, Jeter said, \"Why not? I've always said [I'll be ready], for a long time. I told you it's fine now.\"   The Yankees open the regular season on April 1 against the Red Sox.   The 13-time All-Star broke his ankle going for a ground ball up the middle in Game 1 of the ALCS against the Tigers on Oct. 13. The Yankees were eventually swept by Detroit, and Jeter had surgery one week later. Joey Nowak is a reporter for MLB.com.
