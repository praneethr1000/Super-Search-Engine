    "body": "The Mets on Tuesday reached an agreement with second baseman Daniel Murphy on a one-year deal, avoiding arbitration. Murphy was the last Mets player awaiting an arbitration hearing next month. Murphy's deal, reportedly worth $2.925 million, falls almost exactly in the middle of the $3.4 million he had asked for in arbitration and the $2.55 million the Mets countered with. The 27-year-old infielder hit .291 with six homers and 65 RBIs in 156 games last year, while making approximately $512,000. First baseman Ike Davis and pitcher Bobby Parnell -- the only other Mets players to file for arbitration -- agreed to one-year deals earlier this month for $3.125 million and $1.7 million, respectively.
