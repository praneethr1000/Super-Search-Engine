    "body": "NEW YORK -- As the Jackie Robinson Foundation's celebration of its inspiration's birthday progressed Monday evening, archival action footage of No. 42 in his old Brooklyn Dodgers uniform flickered on LCD screens ringing the ESPN Zone's reception room.  The baseball footage was almost an incongruity for the occasion.  Jackie Robinson played Major League Baseball for 10 years. His foundation, committed to educating young people both in the classroom and in real life, has been around for 33 years. His legacy would appear to have moved light years beyond anything bordered by foul lines.
