    "body": "DENVER -- Rockies star outfielder Carlos Gonzalez might want to pack a first baseman's mitt for Spring Training, just in case. Rockies manager Walt Weiss said nothing extreme is happening. The club isn't planning to move Gonzalez from the outfield, where he has won three Rawlings Gold Glove Awards and appeared in two All-Star Games. But the club has discussed opening that as a possibility. \"CarGo at first base is something we've talked about introducing a little bit this spring, but it's more of a potential longterm outlook,\" Weiss said. Before the Rockies dealt outfielder Corey Dickerson to the Rays in a trade that brought them lefty reliever Jake McGee, there was speculation that Dickerson or Gonzalez could play some first base. Weiss was asked on multiple occasions if Dickerson could be moved to first base, but he always answered with a decisive, \"No.\"Â  \"We're not really looking to circulate him at first base -- just starting to introduce it in a practice setting,\" Weiss said.
