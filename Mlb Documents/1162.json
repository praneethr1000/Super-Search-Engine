    "body": "SEATTLE -- First baseman Mike Jacobs, a seven-year Major League veteran who hit 32 home runs for the Marlins in 2008, has signed a Minor League contract with the Mariners with an invitation to Spring Training.  Jacobs, 32, has played just 20 games in the Majors over the last three years while spending time in the Mets, Blue Jays, Rockies and D-backs organizations.  Last season, Jacobs hit .279 with 18 home runs and 60 RBIs in 101 games for Triple-A Reno and .211 with no home runs and two RBIs in 19 at-bats for the D-backs after being called up on Sept. 19. Jacobs spent all of 2011 in Triple-A ball with the Rockies, batting .298 with 23 home runs and 97 RBIs for Colorado Springs.   The left-handed slugger collected 69 home runs and 224 RBIs in three seasons with the Marlins from 2006-08 and put up 19 homers and 61 RBIs in 128 games with the Royals as a first baseman\/designated hitter in '09.   For his Major League career, Jacobs has batted .253 with a .313 on-base percentage and a .473 slugging percentage in 569 games, totaling 100 home runs and 312 RBIs.   Jacobs is the fourth player known to have signed with the Mariners on a Minor League deal that includes an invitation to Major League camp, joining pitchers Jeremy Bonderman and Jonathan Arias and catcher Jesus Sucre. Like most clubs, the Mariners usually sign 15-20 players as non-roster invites. Greg Johns is a reporter for MLB.com. Follow him on Twitter @GregJohnsMLB as well as his Mariners Musings blog.
