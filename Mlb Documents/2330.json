    "body": "CHICAGO -- One by one, Jerry Reinsdorf, Ken Williams, Geoff Blum, Bobby Jenks and Joe Crede recounted their favorite moment from the 2005 White Sox World Series championship during an entertaining seminar celebrating the 10-year anniversary of this title at SoxFest on Friday night. Reinsdorf, the White Sox chairman, pointed to Scott Podsednik's walkoff homer in Game 2 of the World Series sweep of Houston, humorously adding that he had just finished cussing at Podsednik in his suite during the top of the frame when the left fielder didn't throw out Chris Burke at the plate as the game-tying run with two outs. Crede also went with Podsednik's blast, marking his second shot of the postseason, after not hitting one in the regular season. Jenks went with the amazing pageantry before the start of Game 1, talking about the flashbulbs going off in the stands at every moment. Williams, the architect of the champs, went with the post-sweep celebration he immediately shared with Reinsdorf after Orlando Palmeiro's series-ending groundout. \"Because as long as I've known this man, that's been his greatest desire is to win a World Series,\" Williams said. Before Blum could even present his answer, Reinsdorf joked that it won't be tough to figure out the utility infielder's moment. Of course, Blum's go-ahead home run in the 14th inning of Game 3 of the World Series was the obvious choice, standing as the only World Series at-bat he ever had. \"He has a statue for that one World Series at-bat,\" Williams said. \"Timing is everything,\" Blum responded. Stories and bits of postseason color flowed for close to an hour Friday night, culminating the first day at the Hilton Chicago. The vibe was so positive during Friday's opening Town Hall Meeting involving general manager Rick Hahn and manager Robin Ventura that fans did everything but ask Hahn to run for mayor of Chicago. That excitement over Hahn's seven impact offseason moves extended to Williams, as the team's executive vice president said that he couldn't ever recall wanting to get out to Spring Training this early. But as a sort of sendoff to Arizona, memories from 10 years ago will continue flowing for another two days in downtown Chicago. Crede talked about face-planting on U.S. Cellular Field when he tried to jump over the dugout railing as part of the celebration following Podsednik's blast. Jenks spoke of the hand mark\/claw mark on his shoulder that lasted for two months after Blum's congratulatory grab at the end of World Series. Williams told a great tale of an unknown fan sitting around, talking with players, coaches and front office personnel in Houston following the fourth straight victory, all the while with everyone trying to figure out who this person was. Ozzie Guillen earned praise for his managerial work, although he was not in attendance. Scott Merkin is a reporter for MLB.com. Read his blog, Merk's Works, and follow him on Twitter @scottmerkin.
