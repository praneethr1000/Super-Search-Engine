    "body": "The Giants and Tim Lincecum's representatives had gathered in a hearing room two years ago, the chamber doors figuratively about to be locked shut and an impartial arbiter ready to hear their disparate claims as to the pitcher's monetary worth for the 2010 season. Mere moments before the hearing began, however, the two sides agreed to keep talking, and soon thereafter an agreement was reached without the need to get the arbiter involved. Two years, $23 million. And in the wake of a 2010 World Series victory and two finishes among the top 10 in National League Cy Young Award voting, it certainly looks like money well spent on the Giants' part. The answer would be two. Tom Seaver and Tim Lincecum.            Anthony Castrovince is a reporter for MLB.com. Read his columns and his blog, CastroTurf, and follow him on Twitter at @Castrovince.
