    "body": "SEATTLE -- Right-handed reliever Shawn Kelley signed a one-year contract with the Mariners on Wednesday, avoiding an arbitration hearing and becoming the final player on the 40-man roster to come to terms for the upcoming season. Kelley agreed to a base salary of $935,000, MLB.com has confirmed, with potential bonuses for being with the Major League team at 60, 90, 120 and 150 days that could raise that total to $1.1 million. Kelley had asked for $1.2 million at the Jan. 18 arbitration deadline, while the Mariners offered $750,000. Kelly, 28, made $600,000 in 2012 in his first year of arbitration eligibility as a Super Two qualifier. He pitched 47 games for the Mariners, posting a 2-4 record with a 3.25 ERA in 44 1\/3 innings during three separate stints with the club. Kelley also made 14 appearances for Triple-A Tacoma, going 2-0 with a 0.90 ERA in 20 innings. If Kelley hadn't come to an agreement, the two sides would have gone to a three-person arbitration panel in February. The Mariners haven't had a player go to an arbitration hearing since Freddy Garcia in 2003. Over parts of four Major League seasons with Seattle, the Kentucky native has a 3.52 ERA in 120 relief appearances. He was originally selected in the 13th round of the 2007 First-Year Player Draft out of Austin Peay University. Kelley and the rest of Mariners pitchers and catchers will report to Peoria, Ariz., for the start of Spring Training on Feb. 12.  Greg Johns is a reporter for MLB.com.
