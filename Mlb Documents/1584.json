    "body": "SAN FRANCISCO -- Hunter Pence reported instant success as he tried his hand at \"MLB 13: The Show\" for Sony's PlayStation 3. \"I went deep in my first at-bat,\" said Pence, adding that he was hitting .500 after installing himself in the leadoff spot. Pence can't hit .500 for the Giants. But the spirited right fielder knows that he can exceed the .219 batting average he compiled in 59 regular-season games last year after San Francisco acquired him from Philadelphia. So he has devoted this offseason to improving his speed and relaxing more in the batter's box, which he believes will help him regain his All-Star form. Chris Haft is a reporter for MLB.com.
