    "body": "The signing of free agent Luke Scott prompted the Rays to make a corresponding roster move on Friday.  The team announced that Minor League catcher Nevin Ashley has been designated for assignment. The 27-year-old Ashley was one of five catchers on Tampa Bay's 40-man roster.  Ashley appeared in 80 games with Double-A Montgomery in 2011, and he batted .280 with six home runs and 33 RBIs. He also appeared in 32 games at Triple-A Durham, batting .218. During the offseason, Ashley also played winter ball in the Dominican Republic.   A native of Vincennes, Ind., Ashley was the Rays' sixth-round pick in the 2006 First-Year Player Draft.   On Thursday, Tampa Bay signed Scott to a one-year, $5 million contract that includes a $6 million option and a $1 million buyout for 2013. Joe Frisaro is a reporter for MLB.com.
