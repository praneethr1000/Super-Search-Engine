    "body": "KANSAS CITY -- Infielder Jason Smith was designated for assignment on Friday by the Royals, clearing room on the 40-man roster for catcher Miguel Olivo.  Smith, who was claimed off waivers on July 11 from the Arizona Diamondbacks, hit .188 in 40 games for the Royals. He played every infield position, including 20 games at shortstop.  Eligible for salary arbitration, Smith agreed to terms with the Royals last month. It's possible he could wind up on their Triple-A Omaha roster. Dick Kaegel is a reporter for MLB.com.
