    "body": "ARLINGTON -- The Rangers added to their bullpen candidates on Tuesday by acquiring right-handed reliever Gonzalez Germen from the Yankees for cash considerations. The Yankees obtained Germen from the Mets for cash considerations in December and then designated him for assignment. Germen goes on the Rangers' 40-man roster, which is now full. Germen, 27, had spent his entire career with the Mets and appeared in 54 games for them over the past two seasons. He has a career record of 1-2 with a 4.31 ERA and an opponents' batting average of .248. Germen averages 8.6 hits, 4.2 walks and 8.9 strikeouts per nine innings. His repertoire consists of a 92-mph fastball with a slider and a changeup. \"He has a plus fastball with some moving parts in a slinging delivery and a good changeup,\" Rangers pro scouting director Josh Boyd said.
