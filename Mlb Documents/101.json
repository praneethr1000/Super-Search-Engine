    "body": "PORT ST. LUCIE, Fla. -- The Mets have agreed with No. 1 draft pick Mike Pelfrey on the terms of a four-year contract, Baseball America reported on its Web site on Monday.  Reached for comment on Monday evening, club spokesman Jay Horwitz said that the Mets had nothing to announce at the present time.  Citing two highly placed sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, the report outlined Pelfrey -- a 6-foot-7 right-hander who turns 22 on Saturday -- as receiving a signing bonus of around $3.5 million, with a guaranteed $5.3 million contract. Pelfrey, the Mets' first-round selection (ninth overall) in the June 2005 First-Year Player Draft out of Wichita State University, could earn a maximum of $6.6 million if he is on the Mets' 25-man roster in 2007, 2008 and 2009, according to the report.   Neither Pelfrey nor his representatives, the Scott Boras Corp., could be reached for comment.   Pelfrey was widely considered the top available pitcher in last year's draft and, upon signing, would likely become the Mets' top organizational pitching prospect.   In his junior year at Wichita State, he went 12-3 with a 1.93 ERA in 19 starts, striking out 143 in 139 2\/3 innings.   Bryan Hoch is a contributor to MLB.com.
