    "body": "A right elbow injury that limited right-hander Chris Reitsma to 26 appearances last season has improved enough for the Mariners to offer the veteran reliever another chance to establish himself in Seattle's bullpen.  The Mariners announced Thursday afternoon that they had reached agreement on a one-year Minor League contract with the 30-year-old Reitsma -- almost one year to the day that he signed with Seattle the first time.  Expected to provide late-inning setup relief for closer J.J. Putz, Reitsma continuously battled with discomfort in his elbow and had to be placed on the 15-day disabled list three times -- May 23-June 4; June 11-July 5 and finally on July 30. Terms of the latest deal were not announced, but the right-hander was invited to Spring Training, which begins Feb. 14 in Peoria, Ariz. Reitsma made $1.35 million last year and had an option year on his contract for $2.7 million for 2008. But the Mariners decided on paying a $700,000 buyout.   Jim Street is a reporter for MLB.com.
