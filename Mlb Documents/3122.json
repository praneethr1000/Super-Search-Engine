    "body": "After initially being told to remain idle for the offseason, Twins left-hander Francisco Liriano was permitted to participate in winter ball and made his debut on Wednesday night.  Liriano started and pitched 1 2\/3 innings for the Escogido club in the Dominican Republic. The southpaw gave up one earned run on two hits and one walk while striking out a pair. He was slated to pitch two innings against Licey.  The last time Liriano pitched in the Dominican was 2010, as Minnesota did not allow him to pitch last winter. According to the Minneapolis Star Tribune, Twins general manager Terry Ryan wanted to limit Liriano's innings total and not let him pitch again this winter.
