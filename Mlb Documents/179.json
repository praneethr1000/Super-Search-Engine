    "body": "The biggest deal of the Padres' busy winter is official. First baseman Adrian Gonzalez, outfielder Terrmel Sledge and right-handed pitcher Chris Young are San Diego-bound courtesy of the Texas Rangers in exchange for right-handed pitchers Adam Eaton and Akinori Otsuka and Minor League catcher Billy Killian. \"In Gonzalez, Sledge and Young, we've acquired some talented young players who have had success at the Major League level,\" said Padres vice president\/general manager Kevin Towers. \"Despite giving up some arms in Eaton and Otsuka, we feel that this is a deal that will not only benefit us in the long run, but will also make us a better ballclub in 2006.\" Lyle Spencer is a reporter for MLB.com.
