    "body": "We're done with the campers vs. campers games now, and we have the legends game tomorrow, when the legends play each camper team for two innings. That's where the campers turn the tides against us a little bit.  My team didn't do too well today. We won the first game and lost the second. I think these guys are a little bit tired, maybe the final day kind of caught up with them.  Tomorrow I think they'll be a little more rejuvenated, though, because they get to play against us. It should make for an interesting day. We beat Billy Sample's team in the first game today, and, of course, I gave him a hard time. Any time I can beat my broadcast partner, I like it.",
