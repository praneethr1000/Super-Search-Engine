    "body": "The Minnesota Twins reduced their number of arbitration-eligible players to one on Tuesday by agreeing to terms with infielder Nick Punto on a one-year deal.  The terms of the deal were not disclosed. Punto had been seeking $850,000 with the Twins offering him $625,000.  Punto, 28, batted .239 (94-for-394) with 18 doubles, four triples and 26 RBIs in 112 games for the Twins last season. It was a breakout year of sorts for the young infielder in 2005 as his 13 stolen bases ranked second on the team and Punto established career highs in almost every offensive category.
