    "body": "ARLINGTON -- The Rangers’ top two farm teams will play an exhibition game at 7 p.m. CT on April 2, with the Triple-A Round Rock Express facing the Double-A Frisco RoughRiders at Frisco’s Dr Pepper Ballpark.  This will be the second meeting for the two affiliates. They also met on April 3, 2011, in a game that included 15 players who have gone on to play in the Major Leagues.  “This will be a great way to kick-start the season,” RoughRiders manager Steve Buechele said. “For fans in the Metroplex, this game will be a terrific display of the tremendous amount of talent the Rangers have at the top of their farm system. At that time, the players and coaches on both sides will be looking forward to getting back to playing in the state of Texas after a long Spring Training, so I’m really looking forward to it.” T.R.
