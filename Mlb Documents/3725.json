You can watch the announcement live at 1 p.m. ET on an MLB Network simulcast on MLB.com. Roberto Alomar is confident that he'll make it to the National Baseball Hall of Fame in the Class of 2011. The 10-time Gold Glove Award-winning second baseman barely missed the cut by eight votes on his first ballot attempt last year. \"I hope he gets in, he deserves to get in,\" said his older brother, Sandy Alomar Jr., a former big league catcher and a coach for the Indians when reached at his home in Chicago recently. A player's name must appear on at least 75 percent of the ballots. The Class of 2010 was announced on Jan. 6. Alomar, a 12-time All-Star, was surprised at the time that he didn't make it.                      Barry M. Bloom is national reporter for MLB.com and writes an MLBlog, Boomskie on Baseball.
