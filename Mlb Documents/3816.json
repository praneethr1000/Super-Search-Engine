    "body": "NEW YORK -- The final pitch of Roger Clemens' career, it can be speculated, may have been that 92-mph fastball in Game 3 of last year's American League Division Series.  If the Rocket is intent on changing that, it isn't likely to come with the Yankees.  Hank Steinbrenner told the New York Daily News in Thursday's editions that the team is not interested in signing the 45-year-old right-hander for a third turn in pinstripes. \"I'm not signing Clemens,\" Steinbrenner, the Yankees' senior vice president, told the newspaper, citing the Yankees' wealth of young starting pitching.   Clemens, a seven-time Cy Young Award winner who has vehemently denied the Mitchell Report's allegations that he used performance-enhancing drugs, signed a prorated $28 million contract with the Yankees on May 6 and made his first start for New York on June 9.   But the Yankees' return on their Clemens investment may not have been all that was anticipated when the hurler unexpectedly appeared in George Steinbrenner's private Yankee Stadium suite during a game against the Seattle Mariners and announced he was joining the Yankees.   Clemens was 6-6 with a 4.18 ERA in 17 starts (18 appearances), and slowed by an elbow problem, right foot blisters and a strained left hamstring, he lasted just 2 1\/3 innings in his Game 3 ALDS start against the Indians, walking off after striking out catcher Victor Martinez.   The Yankees have projected a younger rotation mix for new manager Joe Girardi in 2008. Chien-Ming Wang and Andy Pettitte are likely to lead the way for Joba Chamberlain, Phil Hughes and perhaps Ian Kennedy -- all three under 25 and promising -- with Mike Mussina also lending a veteran presence in the rotation.   Steinbrenner said that the Yankees already have a strong mentor for their young pitching in Pettitte, who signed a one-year, $16 million contract in early December -- just before he also was named in the Mitchell Report for using human growth hormone twice during the 2002 season, an allegation he admitted.   \"Andy is [signed] for one year and he's only 35 and he knows how to pitch in the big games,\" Steinbrenner said. \"Roger does, too, but let's face it, he's going to be 46 [in August].   \"Pettitte is just as good with the young pitchers, though Clemens was great with the young kids last year. I don't think Roger is going to come back anyway.\"   Pitching appears to be a secondary consideration for Clemens at this point, though he has spoken in the past about wishing to pitch for Team USA at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, China. In November, Clemens' agent, Randy Hendricks, said that while the Rocket has not officially retired, he is planning to begin honoring his 10-year personal-services commitment with Houston -- part of his contract which was negotiated with the Astros prior to the 2005 season.   More recently, Clemens taped an interview with Mike Wallace of CBS' \"60 Minutes,\" defending allegations made against him by personal trainer Brian McNamee, who accused Clemens of using steroids and human growth hormone in the Mitchell Report. The piece featuring Clemens is scheduled to air Sunday. Bryan Hoch is a reporter for MLB.com. This story was not subject to the approval of Major League Baseball or its clubs.",
