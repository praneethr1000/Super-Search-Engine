    "subtitle": "Ackley, Ruggiano, Jackson, Furbush and Morrison sign before deadline",
    "body": "The Mariners avoided arbitration hearings with five of six eligible players, agreeing to terms with outfielders Dustin Ackley, Justin Ruggiano and Austin Jackson, pitcher Charlie Furbush and first baseman Logan Morrison. Pitcher Tom Wilhelmsen remains the only Mariners arbitration-eligible player who is unsigned. Ackley agreed to a $2.6 million contract with a $500,000 bonus for 500 plate appearances. Ackley made $1.7 million last season when he hit .245 with 14 home runs and 65 RBIs in 143 games. This was his first season eligible for arbitration. Jackson, with five years of service time, agreed to a $7.7 million contract. He made $6 million last year and can be a free agent after the upcoming season. The Mariners acquired Jackson at the non-waiver Trade Deadline on July 31, and he hit just .229 with a .267 on-base percentage and a .260 slugging percentage in 54 games for them. Morrison accepted a $2.725 million contract. He played in 99 games for Seattle in 2014 after being acquired from Miami, and he hit .262 with 11 home runs, 38 RBIs and a .420 slugging percentage. Morrison made $1.75 million last season and is entering his second year of arbitration. This is the first time in arbitration for Furbush and Wilhelmsen. Furbush, who agreed to a $1.3 million deal, was 1-5 with a 3.61 ERA in 67 games and Wilhelmsen was 3-2 with a 2.27 ERA. Ruggiano was acquired from the Cubs in the offseason and agreed to a $2.5 million salary. He played in 81 games for Chicago and hit .281 with six home runs and 28 RBIs. The Mariners had already addressed three other potential arbitration cases. They bought out third baseman Kyle Seager's three arbitration years with his seven-year, $100 million extension earlier this offseason. First baseman Justin Smoak was waived and picked up by the Blue Jays and outfielder Michael Saunders was traded to Toronto. Seattle hasn't had an arbitration hearing with a player since losing their case to pitcher Freddy Garcia in 2003. â€¢ Pitcher Anthony Fernandez has cleared waivers and assigned to Triple-A Tacoma. He was designated for assignment earlier this week after the Mariners acquired pitcher Michael Kickham from the Cubs. Fernandez is recovering from Tommy John surgery on his left elbow, and he is not expected to be ready for Spring Training. T.R. Sullivan is a reporter for MLB.com.
