    "body": "CHICAGO -- The Cubs' Spring Training ballpark in Mesa, Ariz., now will be called Sloan Park. The team announced Sloan Valve Company, a 109-year-old business, as the new naming rights partner. Based in the Chicago area, Sloan has joined the Cubs as a Legacy Partner. Sloan is a leading global manufacturer of water-efficient solutions. A fourth-generation family business, Sloan prides itself on promoting a healthy environment through water conservation. The Cubs will utilize Sloan's products in the Mesa ballpark, and they will target integration inside Wrigley Field and its surrounding facilities as part of the 1060 Project construction. In addition to the naming rights, Sloan will have a branding presence at Wrigley Field, including fixed signage in the visiting team's bullpen. Sloan is the sixth Legacy Partner of the Cubs, joining Anheuser-Busch, ATI Physical Therapy, Starwood Hotels and Resorts, Under Armour and Wintrust. The 2015 Cactus League season will be the second at the ballpark, which had been known as Cubs Park. Carrie Muskat is a reporter for MLB.com.
