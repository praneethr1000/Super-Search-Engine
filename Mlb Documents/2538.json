    "body": "CHICAGO -- Fans and new Cubs players got to know one another Saturday at Cubs Convention at the Sheraton Hotel and Towers in an hour-long question-and-answer session with several of the team's new faces. Left-hander Jon Lester, right-handers Jason Hammel and Jason Motte, catcher Miguel Montero, outfielder Chris Denorfia and infielder Tommy La Stella talked about their families and their most-played music ... and they gave dating advice. A college-aged fan told Motte, a former Cardinal, that he's dating a great girl -- pretty, smart, funny ... but she's a huge Cardinals fan. Motte said he should get a new girlfriend, before asking what the fan's mother thought of the girl. The father interjected and admitted he's a little shaky on her. \"This isn't 'Dr. Phil,'\" Motte said. \"This is way over my head.\" Motte was a crowd favorite, though he got off to a rocky start. Denorfia and Hammel received \"awws\" from the fans after saying they have 7- and 3-month-old children, respectively, but Motte was greeted by boo-birds after being introduced as the former Cardinals closer. The \"boos\" shifted to \"awws\" when he said he had a 2-year-old daughter. Because of that, Taylor Swift's \"Shake It Off\" and songs from \"Frozen\" are the most-played songs on his iPhone, Motte admitted. La Stella also didn't shy away from his love for Swift. \"This might be a little embarrassing because they were joking about it, but Taylor Swift probably is my No. 1,\" La Stella said. \"[Motte's] daughter is 2 years old, but I'm in the car jamming out to 'Blank Space.'\" La Stella and Montero were asked how they found out they were traded to the Cubs. La Stella said he saw a voicemail after waking up from a nap, while Montero said he Googled it. \"I was like, 'All right, Miguel Montero just got traded to the Cubs. Awesome,'\" Montero said. \"When I found out on the Internet, I started getting drunk and celebrating.\" Two young boys wasted no time dropping the gauntlet on the new players. One asked Lester what Kerry Wood thought of the lefty wearing No. 34. \"I just saw him walking down the hall, so I guess we're on speaking terms,\" Lester quipped. \"To be honest, it's an honor. Obviously he's a very big part of this organization and I was very honored that he'd allow me to wear it.\" Another asked the money question: Is this the year the Cubs finally make the playoffs and win the World Series? \"I don't know, but to be honest, I'm pretty sure that all of us are here to win,\" Montero said. \"We're not going to feel comfortable just making the playoffs. We're here to go all the way. It's all or nothing. That's how I feel.\" Good first impression, fellas. Cash Kruth is a reporter for MLB.com. Follow him on Twitter at @cashkruth.
