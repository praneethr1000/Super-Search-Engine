    "body": "Manny Ramirez and Miguel Tejada are staying put, at least for now. But Corey Patterson is moving on after the Cubs dealt the 26-year-old outfielder to Baltimore on Monday for two Minor League players: shortstop Nate Spears and left-handed pitcher Carlos Perez. Patterson, a former first-round pick whose production has yet to match his ability, became expendable when the Cubs acquired Juan Pierre and Jacque Jones this winter. Patterson hit only .215 in 2005 before being sent to the Minors. Spears batted .294 with six home runs and 43 RBIs in 112 games for Class A Frederick in 2005, his third pro season. He was the Orioles' fifth-round pick in the 2003 First-Year Player Draft. Perez, signed by the Orioles as a non-drafted free agent out of the Dominican Republic in 1999, was 11-8 with a 4.28 ERA in 27 starts for Class A Delmarva last year.  Meanwhile another Oriole, Tejada, appears to be staying in Baltimore as various trade scenarios have fallen apart.  The market for Ramirez reportedly has dried up in recent weeks making it more likely the slugger will open the season with the Red Sox.  Elsewhere on the Hot Stove front Monday:    Angels: Now that the Dodgers have chosen not to re-sign Jeff Weaver, the Angels may express some interest in the veteran right-hander. The club has one spot in the rotation that is unsettled and are down two veteran pitchers from last season, with Jarrod Washburn and Paul Byrd signing elsewhere. Jeff's younger brother Jered will be in Angels' camp this spring, competing for a spot in the rotation.  Astros: The Astros signed free agent left-handed reliever Trever Miller to a one-year, $1.3 million contract. The deal includes a one-year vesting option.  General manager Tim Purpura also announced that the club signed left-handed pitcher Carlos Hernandez and catcher Alan Zinter to Minor League contracts with invitations to Major League Spring Training. In addition, the Astros have invited Minor League right-handed pitcher Jared Gothreaux to Major League Spring Training.  Miller, 32, was 2-2 with a 4.06 ERA (20ER\/44.1IP) in 61 games for Tampa Bay in 2005. The 61 appearances marked the second-highest total of his career, and he did not allow a run in his last eight outings of the season. He also spent the 2004 season with the Devil Rays and finished 1-1 with a 3.12 ERA (17ER\/49IP) in 60 appearances, including one save.  Blue Jays: The Toronto Sun reports that Toronto general manager J.P. Ricciardi may still be interested in acquiring free agent catcher Bengie Molina.  \"We still may be able to do something with Molina,\" Ricciardi told the paper. \"We'll have to see how much money we have going forward. We'll still need money next year.\"   When the Blue Jays traded third baseman Corey Koskie on Friday, their team payroll dipped to around $70 million. That might leave enough money to sign Molina, who made $3 million with the Angels last season.  Braves: The Braves haven't told Chris Reitsma that he'll enter Spring Training as their closer. But over the past month, they've at least given him that impression.  Before being rejected by Kyle Farnsworth and losing out in their attempts to land one of the top free agent closers, the club was telling Reitsma that he'd be their \"super setup man.\"   Because the club hadn't told Reitsma it's his job to lose, the belief is that they are still hopeful that they might be able to acquire Danys Baez or another closer via a trade. Currently, the Devil Rays are asking too much for Baez. The Braves hope the cost drops in the coming weeks or even after Spring Training begins.  The Braves would also like to get a right-handed utility player who could help in left field or at first base. They currently have Ryan Langerhans (LF) and Adam LaRoche slated to fill those spots. Jeff Conine's decision to sign with the Orioles may give LaRoche the opportunity to be an everyday player. The left-handed first baseman platooned with the right-handed Julio Franco the past two seasons.  Eddie Perez and Brian Jordan have been invited to Spring Training with Minor League contracts. If Jordan proves he's healthy, he could share time with the left-handed Langerhans.   Brewers: The Brewers happily created a third-base logjam over the weekend when they acquired Corey Koskie from the Blue Jays for an incredibly reasonable price. According to the Toronto Sun, Koskie is owed $5.25 million this season and $5.85 million in 2007, but the Blue Jays agreed to pay $7.1 million of that cost, leaving Milwaukee on the hook for just $2 million per season. In addition, should Koskie fail to get the plate appearances needed to automatically vest his $6.5 million option for 2008, the Blue Jays and Brewers agreed to split a $500,000 buyout.  Brewers GM Doug Melvin called Bill Hall before the deal, which almost certainly means Hall will once again serve as a utility player instead of the starting third baseman as expected. Koskie is a superior defender and the Brewers like the idea of him anchoring an infield that includes 23-year-olds J.J. Hardy and Rickie Weeks and 21-year-old Prince Fielder.   The trade also likely means limited roles for Jeff Cirillo and Russell Branyan, the latter perhaps being expendable because he signed a non-guaranteed contract and the Brewers need a 40-man roster spot for Koskie.   Devil Rays: The Rays are reportedly close to signing former Pirates third baseman Ty Wigginton and former Royals reliever Shawn Camp.  Marlins: The Marlins on Monday continued visiting prospective relocation cities with a stop in Portland, Ore., which was among the runners-up to Washington, D.C., for the Montreal Expos.     Visiting from the Marlins were president David Samson, vice chairman Joel Mael and senior vice president of stadium development Claude Delorme. The Marlins in December visited San Antonio. Other prospective locations include Las Vegas, northern New Jersey and Monterrey, Mexico.  The Marlins have traded once-touted middle infielder Josh Wilson to Colorado for a player to be named later or cash, according to the Sun-Sentinel. Wilson hit .257 with 82 RBIs last season for Triple-A Albuquerque, but went just 1-for-10 in an 11-game trial with the Marlins last September.   Phillies: Now that Miguel Tejada has stated his desire to stay in Baltimore, Bobby Abreu can return to playing right field for the Phillies. The rumored swap never had much of happening, anyway, with obstacles such as Abreu's complete no-trade clause, Tejada's reluctance to play third base, and both teams' desire for pitching in any major deal. Other than that, the deal was a perfect fit.  This will likely cause Jason Michaels' name to be brought up more often, either in a deal for a setup man or a starter. Such an acquistion would determine the fate of Ryan Madson, who assumes whichever role would be still available.  Reds: Just a few hours before Sunday night's deadline, the Reds re-signed free agent infielder Rich Aurilia to a one-year, $1.3 million contract with a $2 million mutual option for the 2007 season.  Because Aurilia declined the Reds' arbitration offer last month, the club would not have been able to re-sign him again until May 1 if the two sides hadn't reached an agreement before midnight.  \"This turned out to be a longer exercise than we envisioned,\" said Reds general manager Dan O'Brien about the contract talks. \"That fact we successfully concluded it is what matters.\"  The buyout clause on the 2007 option will be based on Aurilia's total plate appearances this season.  Red Sox: Now that Tejada has pulled back his request to be traded, the market appears to be drying up for Red Sox slugger Ramirez.   The team, at least publicly, feels that Ramirez will be back in left field in 2006. That said, the Red Sox are now exploring other avenues for a new shortstop, with Tampa Bay's Julio Lugo appearing to be the top target. If the Red Sox can't find a suitable deal for a shortstop, they will begin the season with veteran Alex Cora playing the position.  The Sox also continue to look for options in center field. The Boston Globe reported that the Red Sox have discussed a three-way trade with the Dodgers and A's in which David Wells would go to the Dodgers and Jay Payton would go from Oakland to Boston. Payton was miserable in Boston last year, but only because he wasn't playing every day. If he resurfaced in this rumored deal, it would be as the starting center fielder.   Rockies: Over the weekend, Colorado got a non-roster agreement from utility man Eli Marrero and continued to explore free agent options such as left-handed pitcher Alan Embree and infielders Luis Rivas, Ramon Martinez and Alex S. Gonzalez.  Tigers: The Baltimore Sun reported Monday that the Tigers had offered the Orioles a package of Carlos Guillen, another Major Leaguer and a prospect in exchange for Miguel Tejada. Team president\/general manager Dave Dombrowski declined comment last week when asked about reports he had expressed interest in Tejada. Jim Molony is a writer for MLB.com.
