    "body": "LOS ANGELES -- Initial bids in the auction of the Dodgers and Dodger Stadium were due on Monday, with the sale expected to be completed by April 30.  The sale process, managed by Blackstone Advisory Partners and overseen by the U.S. Bankruptcy Court, resulted in more than two dozen groups receiving confidential financial information. Blackstone and current owner Frank McCourt, who placed the team into bankruptcy protection last June, will present qualified bidders to Major League Baseball, which will approve up to 10 bidders.  From that group, McCourt will select the \"highest and best\" bid by April 1, notify the court by April 6, and the sale will close by April 30, the same day he is required to pay ex-wife Jamie McCourt $131 million to settle their divorce. In recent court filings, the Dodgers listed $573 million of debt. Speculation has the auction bringing an MLB-record sale price of $1.5 billion or more, which would allow all creditors to be fully paid. Neither McCourt, who purchased the Dodgers in 2004 for $431 million, nor his relatives are allowed to directly or indirectly retain any interest in the team. The Dodger Stadium parking lots, at least at the start of the process, are not included in the assets being offered, but their sale can be negotiated.   Among the announced and rumored bidders for the club are: broadcasters Fox, Time Warner and Comcast; former owner Peter O'Malley; Shamrock Holdings president Stanley Gold; former manager Joe Torre, developer Rick Caruso and Byron Trott of BDT Capital; Mark Walter from Guggenheim Partners with Magic Johnson and Stan Kasten; Dennis Gilbert and Imperial Capital; Steven Cohen from SAC Capital Advisors with agent Arn Tellem; Dallas Mavericks owner and investor Mark Cuban; Paychex founder Tom Golisano; Ares Capital co-founder Tony Ressler; Tom Barrack of real-estate developer Colony Capital and real-estate investor Alan Casden; Natural Balance Pet Food president Jerry Herrick with Steve Garvey and Orel Hershiser; former club executive Fred Claire with Bay Area consultant Andy Dolich.   There has also been recent speculation that, with the consent of one or more of the bidders, the Dodgers could make a late run at free-agent first baseman Prince Fielder, who is seeking a long-term deal that could be worth $200 million or more. The Dodgers apparently have been unwilling to add that kind of liability to the balance sheet before the sale because it might negatively impact the purchase price.
