    "body": "The Indians announced several changes to their Major League training staff on Friday.  Assistant athletic trainer Rick Jameyson left the club to become the head athletic trainer for the Red Sox. To fill his spot, the Indians and head athletic trainer Lonnie Soloff promoted Jeff Desjardins to the lead assistant athletic trainer position, with Michael Salazar joining the Major League staff as an assistant athletic trainer as well.  Elsewhere in the organization, James Quinlan was named Triple-A Columbus' athletic trainer after spending four years as the club's rehab coordinator in Goodyear, Ariz. The 38-year-old Desjardins is entering his 12th season with the Indians organization. He has been on the Major League training staff since 2010, and his new role will involve assisting Soloff and traveling full-time with the team.   Salazar has been with the Indians organization since 2000, most recently spending two years as the athletic trainer for Columbus. He was the head athletic trainer for the Dominican Republic's World Baseball Classic team in 2006 and '09, later working in the same role for Aguilas in the Dominican Winter League this offseason.
