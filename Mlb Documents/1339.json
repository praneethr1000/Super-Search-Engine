SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. -- Mark Grace being in attendance at D-backs Fantasy Camp had been a given since the camp began in 2006, but this year there was some question whether he would be here.  The former first baseman was removed as the team's television color commentator in August when he was arrested for DUI for the second time in 15 months. Steve Gilbert is a reporter for MLB.com.
