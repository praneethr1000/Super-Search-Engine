    "body": "The Giants have designated second baseman Marco Scutaro for assignment. Scutaro is still owed $6.66 million in 2015, which is the final year of a $20 million, three-year contract he signed after helping lead the Giants to the 2012 World Series title. The move came after the team signed outfielder Nori Aoki to a one-year deal this week. The Giants plan to keep Scutaro in the organization as he works his way back from a career-threatening back injury. The procedure, performed last month by Dr. Michael Wang, was intended to \"alleviate the troublesome area at level L-2\/L-3\" of Scutaro's spine, according to The Associated Press. At least four months must pass before doctors can determine whether Scutaro will be able to play baseball again. Joey Nowak is a reporter for MLB.com. Follow him on Twitter at @joeynowak.
