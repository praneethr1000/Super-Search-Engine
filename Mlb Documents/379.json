    "body": "After a long period of deliberation, San Francisco Giants slugger Barry Bonds has decided not to play in the World Baseball Classic, he told MLB.com on Monday, reiterating a posting on his Web site.  \"The timing is just not right,\" Bonds said when reached by telephone in Los Angeles. \"I have too many other responsibilities, too many things I have to take care of that are important to me. I owe it to the city (of San Francisco), my knee, my team, the fans and my family. I have to put my greatest effort right now into all of that.\"  Bonds underwent arthroscopic surgery on his right knee three times this past year and played in only 14 games, all in September, as the Giants made a late and unsuccessful run at the San Diego Padres for the National League West title. He had originally said he would play for Team USA in the upcoming tournament that runs from March 3-20 and was placed on the 52-man U.S. provisional roster that was filed this past week. Barry M. Bloom is a national reporter for MLB.com. This story was not subject to the approval of Major League Baseball or its clubs.",
