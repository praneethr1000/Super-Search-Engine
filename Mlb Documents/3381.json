    "body": "MINNEAPOLIS -- There was a time in the 1990s when Chuck Knoblauch appeared well on his way to becoming enshrined in Cooperstown, N.Y.  A .304 hitter in seven seasons as the Twins' second baseman, Knoblauch was on a similar statistical path of Rod Carew, a Hall of Famer and former Twin. Add that to his trademark defense and all-around heads-up play on the diamond and Knoblauch seemed to fit the perfect mold of a Hall of Fame player.  But following a trade to the Yankees before the '98 season, Knoblauch's career endured some setbacks that put his candidacy in danger. And now it will be up to the voters to see if that early success for Knoblauch will be enough to gain him induction into the hallowed halls of Cooperstown. Knoblauch had some great individual seasons during his seven-year stint in Minnesota, including '97, when he set the Twins' single-season record for most stolen bases (62). The 140 runs he scored in '96 are also a club record.           Kelly Thesier is a reporter for MLB.com. This story was not subject to the approval of Major League Baseball or its clubs.",
