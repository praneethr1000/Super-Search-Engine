    "body": "WASHINGTON -- The Nationals named their Minor League managers and coaches for the 2006 season on Wednesday.  Four of the Nationals' six Minor League managers from last season will return. Tim Foli is the lone skipper to return to his same post as skipper of Triple-A New Orleans, which went 64-76 under Foli last year.  Former catcher Randy Knorr goes from Class A Savannah to Class A Potomac, while Bobby Williams will transfer from Class A Vermont to Class A Savannah, and Bobby Henley will go from Class A Potomac to the Gulf Coast League Nationals, replacing Wendell Kim. Former big-league catcher John Stearns joins the Nationals as manager of Double-A Harrisburg, replacing Keith Bodie, while Edgar Caceres will be the skipper of Class A Vermont.   In the coaching ranks, Steve McCatty and Rick Eckstein join Foli in New Orleans; Rick Tomlin and Mike Hart will join Stearns in Harrisburg; and Charlie Corbell and Troy Gingrich will help Knorr in Potomac.   Terry Clark and Jerry Browne will be with Williams in Savannah; Mark Grater and Tony Tarasco join Caceres in Vermont; and Franklyn Bravo and Jason Camilli are expected to help Henley in the rookie league.   In other news, Dr. Bruce Thomas, the Nationals' primary care sports medicine physician, will travel to Puerto Rico on Jan. 21 to check on second baseman Jose Vidro and right-hander Livan Hernandez. Both players had right knee problems last season and are expected to be ready for Spring Training.  Bill Ladson is a reporter for MLB.com.
