    "body": "Former Cardinals shortstop David Eckstein turned 40 on Tuesday, and he spent the day celebrating the gift of life. Eckstein comes from a family riddled with kidney failure. His father, two brothers and two sisters all have had kidney transplants. His mother, who is in Stage 5 kidney failure, might be the next up for a kidney transplant. On Tuesday, Eckstein helped raise $40,000 to assist in the building of the new Transplant House at Florida Hospital. \"I've already been given a gift, and that's the gift of life through organ donation,\" Eckstein said on MLB Network's High Heat. \"It's just a great organization that hopefully we can help somebody out.\" Eckstein says a typical kidney lasts 20-25 years, but thanks to technology, kidney transplant patients who receive organs from their siblings might have a longer window. \"Hopefully if I have to donate to my sister, it will last a long time, and [brother] Kenny, who has my brother Rick's, will last a long time,\" Eckstein said.
