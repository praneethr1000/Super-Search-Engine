He went 0-3 with a 7.44 ERA in 28 relief appearances, allowing five home runs in 32 2-3 innings.  He was sent down to the Minors on June 17 and went 5-1 with a 2.40 ERA in 13 starts with Triple-A Sacramento before being recalled to the Majors inSeptember. In five seasons with Oakland, Atlanta and the Chicago Cubs, Cruz is 14-24 with a 4.36 ERA.   Cruz can also receive up to $50,000 in bonuses based on appearances. He would get $15,000 for making 45 appearances, an additional $15,000 for 50 appearances, and $20,000 more for 55 games pitched.   The A's previously agreed to one-year deals with outfielders Milton Bradley and Bobby Kielty and reliever Kiko Calero. They have two more arbitration-eligible players yet to be signed: catcher Adam Melhuse and second baseman Mark Ellis.",
