    "body": "CLEVELAND -- Just when the Indians finally had Johan Santana figured out, he leaves the league. Go figure. Yet even though the Tribe apparently had Santana's number in beating him an unprecedented five times in 2007, the club hardly views the two-time Cy Young Award winner's impending move to the Mets as a negative.
