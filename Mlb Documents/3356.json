    "body": "Right-hander Matt Belisle came to terms on a one-year, $1.25 million contract on Thursday, leaving second baseman Brandon Phillips as the team's only arbitration-eligible player still without a contract for 2008.  After earning $390,000 last season, the 27-year-old Belisle had originally asked for $1.65 million when he exchanged numbers with the Cincinnati ballclub back on Jan. 18. The Reds had countered with an offer of $1 million.  Belisle finds himself among a pool of Reds pitchers vying for a starting spot behind Aaron Harang and Bronson Arroyo, as the Reds prepare to begin Spring Training. After working almost exclusively as a reliever during the previous two seasons, Belisle joined the starting rotation last season and posted a career high 177 2\/3 innings in 30 starts. In those 30 starts, the right-hander went 8-9 with a 5.32 ERA and allowed 26 homers.   The transition from a starter to reliever wasn't always a smooth one for Belisle, however, as he picked up just three wins in his final 19 starts of the season.     In addition to the $1.25 million base salary he will earn in 2008, Belisle has incentives built in based on innings pitched that can raise that total by $100,00. The right-hander will earn an additional $25,000 for reaching 175, 185, 200 and 210 innings apiece.   With Belisle locked down for the season, Cincinnati can now turn its full attention to Phillips, who is also in his first year of arbitration eligibility. When arbitration figures were exchanged, Phillips and the Reds were $1.5 million apart. Phillips asked for $4.2 million, while the Reds made a $2.7 million offer.
