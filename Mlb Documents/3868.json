    "body": "TORONTO -- Just a few days removed from undergoing surgery on his right knee last September, Shaun Marcum walked through the Blue Jays' clubhouse like nothing happened. The crutches he'd been given rested against a wall.  That display summed up Marcum's determination to bounce back from the late-season injury quickly. So, it should come as no surprise that the young pitcher is ahead of schedule this offseason, which he's using to prepare for his return to the Jays' rotation.  Back home in Kansas City on Thursday, Marcum worked off a mound for the first time this winter. That step in Marcum's offseason program came a little earlier than scheduled, according to the plan he was given by Toronto's training staff. Marcum couldn't help himself, though. \"I don't think they want us throwing off a mound for another week,\" Marcum said. \"But I didn't wait. I was itching to get up there to see how I felt.\"   So far, Marcum said he's experienced no lingering issues while running through various activities this offseason. Besides some occasional early-morning stiffness, the meniscal tear Marcum suffered in his right knee on Sept. 22 hasn't been an issue while jogging, throwing or working out.   \"It doesn't bother me once I'm up moving around in the morning,\" Marcum said. \"I feel good on the treadmill running and when I'm on the bike and everything else. It feels fine.\"   That's great news for Marcum and the Blue Jays, who are hoping the 26-year-old right-hander can build on his performance last season. Marcum moved into Toronto's rotation in May and went 11-4 with a 3.91 ERA over 25 starts for the Jays. Overall, Marcum finished 12-6 with a 4.13 ERA in 38 appearances.   This winter, when he hasn't been chasing his 15-month-old son Ryne around, Marcum has dedicated plenty of time to breaking down footage of his starts. While watching performances like the no-hit bids he turned in on May 13 against the Rays and Aug. 10 against the Royals can be fun, Marcum said he's been focusing more on the outings he labored through.   \"I've got all the DVDs from my games,\" Marcum said. \"So, I've been going back and watching them and trying to just make adjustments and take down notes on the hitters. I'm just trying to get better that way, as well as lifting and getting bigger and stronger.   \"I'll watch some of the good games, but I'll go back and I'll watch [the poor starts], and I go back to see what I did in certain situations where I got behind, if it was mechanical or just bad pitches, or whatever the case may be. That way I'll know for next year.\"   Marcum wasted no time in beginning his preparation for next season. A week after the season ended for Toronto, the pitcher started working out and began his rehab from the knee surgery he had on Sept. 26. By mid-December, Marcum was playing catch again, and now he's worked his way back onto a mound.   \"I started rehab the week after returning home to Kansas City,\" he said. \"I've been working out ever since I got back and have just been busting my butt to try to get better and get bigger and stronger for next season.\"   The Jays' pitchers and catchers aren't required to be in Dunedin, Fla., for Spring Training until Feb. 15, but Marcum said he plans on heading down during the first week of February. As things currently stand, Marcum is projected to be Toronto's fourth starter behind ace Roy Halladay and right-handers A.J. Burnett and Dustin McGowan.   It's a pitching staff that has the potential to be one of the top groups in the American League and has Marcum excited about the upcoming season.   \"I was talking to my strength guy today,\" Marcum said, \"and I told him, 'Watch out for Dustin. He's going to be one of the best pitchers in the game in the next couple years.' Then you've got Doc [Halladay], who's already one of the best, and A.J., you saw what he did last year when he was healthy.   \"That's the main thing, if we can all stay healthy -- not just the pitchers, the whole team -- we could have something special there and it could be a big year for us.\" Jordan Bastian is a reporter for MLB.com.
