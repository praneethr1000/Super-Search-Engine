    "body": "First baseman-outfielder Jake Goebbert, whom the Padres designated for assignment last week to make room for right-handed pitcher Josh Johnson, has cleared waivers and been assigned to the Friars' Triple-A club in El Paso, the club announced Wednesday. Goebbert, 27, batted .218 with one home run and 10 RBIs in 51 games last season -- his first in the Major Leagues. He hit .273 with three RBIs and a .385 on-base percentage in his 26 pinch-hit plate appearances. Goebbert batted .296 with 14 homers and 60 RBIs in 79 games in Triple-A with the Athletics and Padres organizations. The Padres acquired Goebbert as part of the deal that sent Kyle Blanks to the A's on May 15. Thomas Harding is a reporter for MLB.com.
