    "body": "SEATTLE -- The Mariners avoided arbitration with utilityman Willie Bloomquist, but the club had not agreed with starter Gil Meche late Tuesday afternoon.  The Mariners and Bloomquist, 28, agreed Tuesday to a two-year deal worth a reported $1.525 million.  Bloomquist will likely compete with Jose Lopez for the starting second base job. Bloomquist was one of the Mariners' most versatile players in 2005, starting at first base, second, third, shortstop and in the outfield. He had 249 at-bats, a career-high total, and batted .257 with 15 doubles, 22 RBIs and 14 stolen bases.   \"Bloomquist gives us a lot of versatility coming off the bench or from a starting role,\" Mariners general manager Bill Bavasi said. \"He helps us in a variety of roles, including the ability to steal a base and play almost any position on the field.\"   Bloomquist didn't play after Aug. 30 last year because of a strained left hamstring that put him on the disabled list for the remainder of the season.   Meanwhile, Meche remained the only player on the team still eligible for arbitration and traded numbers with Seattle.   Meche, who went 10-8 with a 5.09 ERA and has slightly over five years of Major League service time, asked for $4.2 million a year after making $2.535 million in 2005. The Mariners countered with an offer of $3.35.  Doug Miller is a reporter for MLB.com. This story was not subject to the approval of Major League Baseball or its clubs.",
