The left-hander has agreed to a Minor League deal with an invitation to Major League Spring Training, according to ESPN.com. The club has not confirmed the deal. Willis, 33, has not pitched in the big leagues since 2011 with the Reds. From 2009-11, he appeared in big league games for the Tigers, D-backs and Reds. He has since signed deals with the Phillies, Orioles, Cubs, Angels and Giants, appearing in two games for San Francisco's Triple-A Fresno affiliate last year. An All-Star in 2003 -- when he won the National League Rookie of the Year Award with the Marlins -- and '05, Willis owns a 72-69 career record with a 4.17 ERA. Joey Nowak is a reporter for MLB.com.
