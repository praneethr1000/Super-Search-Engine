    "body": "Ichiro Suzuki, who has been entrenched atop the Mariners' lineup since arriving in Seattle in 2001, could find his name penciled in the lineup card in a place other than leadoff next season, Mariners manager Eric Wedge told ESPN 710 in Seattle on Wednesday.  Wedge told the radio station there's a \"good possibility\" he'll drop the 10-time All-Star outfielder in the lineup.  \"I've been doing a ton of thinking about that and I still haven't decided what I'm going to do,\" Wedge said. \"I've got a vision in mind in regards to what I want to see happen. Obviously I've got to work off of Ichiro a little bit, but ultimately I'm going to do what I think's best to give us the best chance to score runs, because it's too important for us to make a huge step offensively.\" Ichiro has basically always been Seattle's leadoff hitter throughout his 11-year career, batting leadoff in 1,720 of the 1,733 games (99 percent) he has started. The 38-year-old outfielder, whose illustrious career in both Japan and the U.S. has been predicated on his speed and ability to get on base, is coming off the worst season of his career, however, as he posted a career-low .310 on-base percentage in 2011. His previous low was .350 in 2005 and for his career, Ichiro has reached base at a .370 clip.   When asked again about removing Ichiro from the leadoff spot, Wedge said, \"If you had to put a gun to my head right now, I'd probably be leaning in that direction.\"   Wedge mentioned second-year second baseman Dustin Ackley -- who last year posted a .348 on-base percentage while mainly hitting in the three-hole -- as a potential replacement for Ichiro, who is entering the final year of his contract.
