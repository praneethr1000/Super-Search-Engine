    "body": "ST. LOUIS -- The Cardinals wrapped up all four of their pending arbitration cases on Friday, agreeing to terms with reliever Seth Maness, closer Trevor Rosenthal, first baseman Matt Adams and first baseman\/outfielder Brandon Moss before players and teams were to exchange desired salary figures. In reaching one-year agreements with each of the four, the Cardinals are assured of avoiding any arbitration hearings next month. Rosenthal, 25, set the Cardinals' franchise record for single-season saves with 48 in 2015 while posting a 2.10 ERA. He has accumulated 93 saves during his past two years as the Cardinals' closer, becoming the third youngest player in history to accrue consecutive 40-save seasons. Rosenthal will earn $5.6 million in 2016, a ten-fold raise for the first-time arbitration-eligible closer, who made $535,000 last season. This next season will be Rosenthal's third as a full-time closer. Moss, who made $6.5 million last season, will receive $8.25 million in his final season of arbitration eligibility. Moss joined the Cardinals just prior to the non-waiver Trade Deadline last summer in a swap for prospect Rob Kaminsky. He played in 51 games down the stretch and posted a .250\/.344\/.409 slash line, with four home runs and eight RBIs. Despite the rocky first impression, Moss, who has averaged 24 homers over the past four years, is projected to begin the year as the team's starting first baseman. He takes that job from Adams, 27, who was arbitration-eligible for the first time after being limited to 60 games in 2015 due to a quad injury. In his limited action, Adams batted .240\/.280\/.377 with just five home runs. Adams agreed to a $1.65 million deal. Maness, who will make $1.4 million, was one of the biggest workhorse relievers in the National League last season; he pitched in a career-high 76 games, tied for fifth most in the NL. His ability to induce double-play balls last season (11 tied him for fourth among NL relievers) made him crucial in tight spots for the Cards. Maness qualified for his first year of arbitration-eligibility because of Super Two status. Jenifer Langosch is a reporter for MLB.com.
