    "body": "CINCINNATI -- A formalized contract between the Reds and prospective new closer Ryan Madson might take several days to complete. A source told MLB.com on Wednesday that Madson will get a one-year guaranteed contract that pays him $6 million in 2012 with an $11 million option for 2013 that carries a $2.5 million buyout. Some of the money will be spread out over four years. One of the issues holding up a deal being formalized is that Madson is on vacation and has yet to be scheduled for a physical. Reds general manager Walt Jocketty is currently attending the owners meetings in Phoenix and could not be reached for comment. Mark Sheldon is a reporter for MLB.com.
