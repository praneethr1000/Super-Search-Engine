    "body": "BOSTON -- The Red Sox will have a familiar lefty back in their bullpen in 2015, as Craig Breslow officially re-upped with the club on a one-year, $2 million deal on Wednesday. To make room for Breslow on the 40-man roster, catcher Dan Butler was designated for assignment. A key part of Boston's bullpen during the World Series championship season of 2013, Breslow struggled in '14, perhaps due to carryover fatigue from the year before. The Red Sox traded lefty setup man Andrew Miller on July 31, and they then lost out on his services to the Yankees during free agency. A nine-year veteran, Breslow has pitched in 479 Major League games, going 22-23 with a 3.20 ERA. Breslow first pitched for the Red Sox in 2006, before moving on for stints with the Indians, Twins, D-backs and Athletics. Boston reacquired Breslow in a trade with Arizona on July 31, 2012. In 2013, Breslow sparkled for the Red Sox, posting a 1.91 ERA. Last season, he was largely ineffective for the first time in his career, notching a 5.96 ERA in 60 games.
