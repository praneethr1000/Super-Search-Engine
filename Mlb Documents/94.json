    "body": "CHICAGO -- Wrigley Field may be just what Jacque Jones needs.  The natural grass will be welcome for the new Chicago Cubs right fielder after spending seven years on the Metrodome's harsh turf.  \"My body was saying, 'Thank you,'\" Jones said Tuesday at an introductory news conference. \"There's no substitute for grass.\" Playing day games rather than in a domed stadium also is a plus for Jones, who says he's routinely up at 7:30 a.m. every day. He won't have to guess on fly balls that often were lost against the Metrodome roof.   \"I'll get to enjoy more beautiful days outside,\" Jones said.   Most important, Jones will no longer have to watch well-hit balls land in what he dubbed \"Death Valley\" -- the left-center field area at the Metrodome, in which a lot of his potential extra-base hits were caught. And the friendlier dimensions and a return to the approach of using the whole field should help Jones get back to being a .300 hitter.   \"I call it 'Death Valley' because I'd hit a ball good and someone would run it down,\" said Jones, who hit .249 last season with the Twins, the lowest of his professional career. \"Maybe now those balls will go off the wall, or bounce over the wall or go over the wall. My goal is to get back to being a .300 hitter, and that's spraying the ball all over, and I think this park is made for that.\"   Jones, 30, admitted he was trying to pull the ball too much the last two seasons in an attempt to do more for the punchless Twins.   \"I won't have so much pressure to hit so many home runs or drive in so many runs here,\" he said. \"They've got two big guns here in Derrek [Lee] and Aramis [Ramirez]. I'm here to complement those guys, and that's what I'll do.   \"I think the main focus for other teams will be, 'Don't let Aramis beat us, don't let Derrek beat us,'\" Jones said. \"I think when the game's on the line, those two guys won't see too many pitches to hit. Maybe pitchers will make some mistakes and they'll hit balls in the gap, and there will be second-and-third situations and we'll come up and have to do some situational hitting.\"   Jones comes from an organization that emphasized doing the little things, good fundamentals and making productive outs -- not just striking out.       He most likely won't post power numbers the way Sammy Sosa did for so many seasons for the Cubs. A career .279 hitter, Jones' home run season high was 27 in 2002.   \"Twenty-five homers, and somewhere around .300, 80, 90 runs driven in,\" he said when asked what numbers to expect. \"I wasn't fortunate enough to have a good lineup like this when I was in Minnesota. A lot of people keyed on myself and Torii [Hunter] when I was over there. I won't say I'll get lost in this lineup, but it'll be a little easier for me to hit in this lineup.\"   The addition of Jones means the Cubs will open the 2006 season with a completely new outfield. Matt Murton will start in left and Juan Pierre, acquired from the Marlins in December, will start in center. After six weeks, Jones said the trio should have a feel for what each other can do.   Jones also got some advice from LaTroy Hawkins, even though some people might think the reliever would have nothing but negative vibes after his brief stay in 2004-05 until he was traded in late May.   \"Contrary to what people believe, it was a good experience for him,\" Jones said of Hawkins' stay in Chicago. \"He had nothing but good things to say about the organization, the players, and he still loved the city no matter what happened on the field. He told me I was in a good situation, especially since I wasn't a pitcher.\" Carrie Muskat is a reporter for MLB.com.
