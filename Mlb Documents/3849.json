    "body": "ST. PETERSBURG -- The Rays added to their catching depth Monday when they signed veteran Mike DiFelice to a Minor League contract with an invitation to Major League Spring Training.  DiFelice, 38, was an original member of the Rays, appearing in 242 games for the Rays from 1998 until he was dealt to the Diamondbacks at the 2001 non-waiver trade deadline.  A resident of Safety Harbor, Fla., DiFelice has spent all or part of the last 12 seasons at the Major League level, batting .235 with 28 home runs and 163 RBIs in 548 career games with the Rays, Cardinals (1996-97, 2002), Diamondbacks (2001), Royals (2003), Tigers (2004), Cubs (2004) and Mets (2005-07). He has postseason experience with St. Louis (2002), the team that originally selected him in the 11th round of the 1991 First-Year Player Draft. The Rays selected DiFelice with their 10th pick in the 1997 Expansion Draft.   The team's catching situation now includes starter Dioner Navarro, with Shawn Riggans and DiFelice competiting for the backup spot. Bill Chastain is a reporter for MLB.com.
