    "body": "In the first week of 2012, it was the same-old stand-by for Prince Fielder, the marquee name crackling on the Hot Stove.  The new year got off to an odd start, with teams collectively losing nearly as much manpower as they gained. A trio of free-agent signings were offset by surgeries to Texas reliever Mike Adams and Baltimore outfielder Nick Markakis that could have them sidelined for at least the start of Spring Training.  While Fielder remains without a team and plays the field, most of the American League East remains without designated hitters and is wading in a pool infested with veteran DHs.
