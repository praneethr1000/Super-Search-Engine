    "subtitle": "",
    "body": "Along with 130 of their peers, Rangers players David Murphy, Neftali Feliz and Matt Harrison filed for salary arbitration Tuesday. The Rangers will exchange figures with each of those players Friday, and negotiations can continue up until the time of their hearings, which begin Feb. 4. Texas, however, has not had an actual arbitration hearing with a player since Lee Stevens in 2000, making it likely the sides can reach an agreement in the coming weeks. Murphy, who will be a free agent after this season, made $3,625,000 in 2012. He is expected to be the Rangers' everyday left fielder, after playing in a career-high 147 games last year while hitting .304 with 15 home runs and 61 RBIs. Harrison made $2.95 million in 2012, and the southpaw made good on that contract by going 18-11 with a 3.29 ERA in 32 starts, earning a place on the American League All-Star team and being honored as the Rangers' Pitcher of the Year.  Harrison is slated to hit free agency following the 2014 season, but the Rangers are hoping to lock him up with a long-term deal in the near future.  Then there's the right-handed Feliz, who earned $502,000 last season. He was 3-1 with a 3.16 ERA in seven starts and one relief appearance, before his season was cut short because of injury. Feliz underwent Tommy John surgery Aug. 1 and is not expected back until the final two months of the season. Jane Lee is a reporter for MLB.com.
