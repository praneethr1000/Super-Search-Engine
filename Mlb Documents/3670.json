    "body": "ARLINGTON -- Shortly after announcing that the Rangers had signed pitcher Yu Darvish, general manager Jon Daniels was cornered off-stage and asked about the possibility of pursuing free-agent first baseman Prince Fielder.  \"After going through this process, I'm intimately familiar with our budget,\" Daniels said. \"It's very unlikely.\"  Said Rangers president Nolan Ryan, \"We'll just have to see where things go the rest of the winter and see what our opportunities are.
