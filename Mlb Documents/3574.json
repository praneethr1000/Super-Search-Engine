    "body": "So it turns out the Tigers were the \"mystery team\" in the Prince Fielder sweepstakes. And it's no mystery why they went all-in on Cecil's son. As replacements for an injured Victor Martinez go, this one's tough to top. Just when the outside world was beginning to wonder if agent Scott Boras would be able to find a suitable deal for his prized slugger, the Tigers stepped in with what is reported to be a nine-year, $214 million deal for Fielder. It's a gargantuan contract that not only compares with what Albert Pujols will receive from the Angels in average annual value ($24 million) but also sets Fielder up to be eligible for free agency again at 36.
