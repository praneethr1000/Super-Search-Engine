    "body": "After a slow couple of weeks during the Holiday season, the Hot Stove seems primed to heat back up. Here's a look at the latest stories circulating around the big leagues on Tuesday: Fowler in Bay Area  Dexter Fowler tweeted a photo of himself sitting courtside at the Golden State Warriors game Monday night, with his financial adviser seated next to him. Curious, considering the Giants are not too far away and are still searching for help in the outfield, with center fielder Angel Pagan hampered by injuries and inconsistencies the past few seasons and left fielder Gregor Blanco currently slated as their everyday left fielder. Fowler, 29, is coming off a strong season with the Cubs in which he sported a .250\/.346\/.411 slash line, with 17 homers and 20 stolen bases. San Francisco has already dished out large contracts to Johnny Cueto and Jeff Samardzija this offseason, so the club could be looking to avoid the more expensive outfielders remaining -- Yoenis Cespedes, Justin Upton and Alex Gordon. D-backs seem out on Kendrick D-backs general manager Dave Stewart told MLB.com's Steve Gilbert that the club is not interested in surrendering another Draft pick in order to sign additional free agents this offseason. Arizona already gave up the 13th overall pick when it signed Zack Greinke, and its next pick is the 37th section (Competitive Balance Round A). So it appears the D-backs can be ruled out on signing any of the nine remaining free agents tied to Draft-pick compensation, including second baseman Howie Kendrick, who was linked to Arizona on Monday night. Kendrick has also been linked to the Angels as a potential fit. Stewart added that the club would like to add another infielder, if possible, but he is confident the team can get more production from its current crop of infielders. Mets, Orioles in talks with Antonio Bastardo  The Mets and Orioles are both in need of more bullpen help, and they are among the teams in discussions for left-hander Antonio Bastardo, according to ESPN's Buster Olney. Hot Stove Tracker Bastardo, 30, was a member of the Pirates' strong bullpen in 2015, and he posted a particularly strong second half (with a 2.32 ERA in his last 34 games) and finished a 2.98 overall. Even though both teams have left-handed options in the bullpen, Bastardo's splits were strong last season against hitters on both sides at the plate (.210\/.311\/.315 against righties and .138\/.233\/.215 vs. lefties). Bastardo has reportedly been seeking a three-year deal near the value fellow free-agent lefty Tony Sipp received ($18 million) this offseason. Jamal Collier is a reporter for MLB.com.
