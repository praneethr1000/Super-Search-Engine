    "body": "DENVER -- The Rockies have been lauding left-hander Drew Pomeranz as an important figure in their future from the day they acquired him from the Indians in the deal that sent star pitcher Ubaldo Jimenez to Cleveland.  Turns out Pomeranz doesn't necessarily need to be praised to produce.  \"Last year I went to Indians Spring Training, and the first day they sat me down and said, 'Oh, you're not competing for a spot,'\" Pomeranz said. \"That fired me up a little bit. I was like, 'Oh, really? I'm not?' I went out and didn't give up a hit the whole big league camp.\" Thomas Harding is a reporter for MLB.com.
