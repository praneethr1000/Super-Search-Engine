    "body": "The legendary Billy Joel will return to San Francisco for the first time in four decades for a concert at AT&T Park later this year. The Sept. 5 show will be the six-time Grammy winner's lone appearance in California in 2015. \"We are thrilled to host Billy Joel at AT&T Park for the first time in his illustrious career,\" Giants president and CEO Larry Baer said in a statement. \"It's hard to believe it's been over four decades since Billy last played in the city of San Francisco, but I'm confident the city will welcome him with open arms. Billy's star power, combined with our world-class venue, will make for an unforgettable show.\" Joel's last headlining performance in San Francisco was at the Great American Music Hall in 1975.
