    "body": "NEW YORK -- Categorizing the deal as a risk worth taking, Yankees general manager Brian Cashman heaped praise Monday on catching prospect Jesus Montero, whom he officially dealt to the Mariners in a four-player swap to net pitcher Michael Pineda.  \"He may very well be the best player I've traded, and I've been doing this for quite some time,\" Cashman said of Montero. \"He's that good.\"  The Yanks officially acquired right-handers Pineda and Jose Campos in exchange for Montero and right-hander Hector Noesi on Monday, filling a need at the front end of their rotation while simultaneously parting with one of the top hitting prospects in baseball.
