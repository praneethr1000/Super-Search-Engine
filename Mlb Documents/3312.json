    "body": "ST. LOUIS -- General manager John Mozeliak confirmed on Wednesday that the Cardinals have signed catcher Koyie Hill to a Minor League contract. Hill, who turns 33 in March, spent the past five seasons with the Cubs organization.  The Cardinals are still most likely to go with Tony Cruz as their backup catcher for 2012, following the youngster's solid showing as a rookie in 2011. But Hill offers depth at the position, joining Bryan Anderson as potential challengers to Cruz for playing time or options at Triple-A Memphis.  Hill has played parts of eight seasons, spending time with the Dodgers and Diamondbacks as well as Chicago. He's a lifetime .211 hitter with a .275 on-base percentage, a .298 slugging percentage, eight homers and 75 RBIs in 927 big league plate appearances. He has thrown out 49 of 177 would-be base-stealers in his career, a caught-stealing rate of 28 percent.",
