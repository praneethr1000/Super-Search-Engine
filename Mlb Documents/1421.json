    "body": "PHILADELPHIA -- The Phillies have signed veteran right-hander Rodrigo Lopez to a Minor League contract with a Spring Training invitation. Phils fans might remember Lopez, 37. He pitched for Philadelphia in 2009, going 3-1 with a 5.70 ERA in seven appearances (five starts). Pedro Martinez eventually bumped him from the rotation. Lopez will provide pitching depth to the organization, particularly at Triple-A Lehigh Valley. Lopez went 0-1 with a 5.68 ERA in four appearances last season with the Cubs. The Mexican baseball magazine Puro Beisbol first reported the signing. Todd Zolecki is a reporter for MLB.com. This story was not subject to the approval of Major League Baseball or its clubs.",
