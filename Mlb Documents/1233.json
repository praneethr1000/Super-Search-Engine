    "body": "The Mets are bringing back veteran left-hander Pedro Feliciano, as the club announced on Monday it has signed the reliever to a Minor League contract with an invitation to Spring Training.  The 36-year-old signed a two-year, $8 million deal with the Yankees in 2011, but he spent nearly the entire time battling a left shoulder injury and never played in the big leagues while in the organization. He has only pitched off a big league mound in a Mets uniform during his eight-year career.  Feliciano debuted in 2002 with New York, and from '08-10 he increased his workload to an average of nearly 89 appearances per year while leading the league in appearances for each of those three seasons. He is 22-19 with a 3.31 ERA for his career.  Joey Nowak is a reporter for MLB.com.
