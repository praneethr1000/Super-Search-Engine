    "body": "CINCINNATI -- For the third time in as many winters, Reds right-handed starting pitcher Mike Leake avoided arbitration with the club. On Friday, ahead of a deadline for clubs and players to exchange salary figures, Leake and Cincinnati agreed to a one-year deal worth $9.775 million. Leake, 27, made $5.925 million last season, and despite having a sub-.500 record, turned in a solid 2014. He was 11-13 with a 3.70 ERA while setting career highs with 214 1\/3 innings, 33 starts and 164 strikeouts. A first-round Draft pick of the Reds in 2009, Leake went directly to the Majors after he earned a spot in the rotation out of Spring Training in 2010. Over his five-year career, Leake is 53-42 with a 3.92 ERA in 147 games, including 142 starts. Leake can become a free agent after the 2015 season. Mark Sheldon is a reporter for MLB.com.
