    "body": "WASHINGTON -- Nationals pitchers Tyler Clippard, Gio Gonzalez, Tom Gorzelanny, John Lannan and Jordan Zimmermann, plus catcher Jesus Flores and outfielder Michael Morse filed for salary arbitration on Friday.  As part of the process, the arbitration filing period ran from Jan. 5 until Friday, with Jan. 17 set as the day for salary arbitration figures to be exchanged. From there, salary arbitration hearings are from Feb. 1-21 in St. Petersburg.  Lannan had a nice comeback season in 2011, going 10-13 with a 3.70 ERA, while making $2.75 million. Morse, who made $1.05 million last year, was the Nationals' Most Valuable Player, hitting .303 with 31 home runs and 95 RBIs, while playing first base and left field.   Gorzelanny and Flores are arbitration-eligible for the third year in a row. Gorzelanny will be the team's long man out of the bullpen this upcoming season.   After missing two years because of a shoulder injury, Flores will likely begin the season as the backup catcher. He played 30 games this past season and went 18-for-86 [.209] with a home run and two RBIs.   Clippard, Gonzalez and Zimmermann are all arbitration-eligible for the first time. Clippard was clearly Washington's best pitcher, appearing in 72 games with a 1.83 ERA. He also made his first All-Star appearance last July.   Gonzalez, who was acquired in a trade that sent four Minor Leagues to the Athletics last month, was a 16-game winner for Oakland with a respectable 3.12 ERA.   Zimmermann made a nice comeback after recovering from Tommy John surgery and became the team's best starter in '11. He won eight games and had a 3.18 ERA.
