    "body": "MINNEAPOLIS -- New addition Mike Pelfrey made his first appearance at TwinsFest on Saturday, and said that he's expecting to enter Spring Training without any limitations. Pelfrey, who underwent Tommy John surgery on his right elbow on May 1, is ahead of schedule in his rehab and plans on entering the season just like any other. \"When I signed, they kind of gave me a three-week break,\" said Pelfrey, who signed a one-year deal worth $4 million on Dec. 20. \"I picked it back up and threw 45 pitches yesterday before I came. I cranked it back up. I plan on going to Spring Training with no restrictions and being like any other guy there, be ready to go.\" Pelfrey said he's excited about switching over to the American League and has heard only positive things about the Twins and Target Field. His only big league experience has come with the Mets, as he has a career 4.36 ERA in 896 1\/3 innings. He added that he's excited about the prospects of turning around the team after the Twins finished in last place each of the last two seasons. \"Obviously I wasn't here last year, but I've had guys tell me the biggest struggle was the starting rotation,\" Pelfrey said. \"The thing they brought up was a lot of times, the second or third inning, you're down 5-0 early. I think the offense starts to press. It obviously makes it tough on the bullpen. They've brought some guys in, [Vance] Worley and [Kevin] Correia and myself, that I think we can get this thing turned around and get a lot more consistency in keeping them in ballgames. From my understanding, this offense is going to put up some runs. If we can keep them in the game and get the ball over to the bullpen, I like our chances.\"",
