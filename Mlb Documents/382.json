    "body": "During his workouts in recent weeks, Lance Berkman felt something that wasn't the normal soreness an athlete usually experiences while going through his standard offseason regimen.  An MRI confirmed that Berkman has scar tissue in his right knee, and he'll undergo surgery on Thursday to remedy that problem. Team medical director David Lintner will perform the procedure at The Methodist Hospital. Recovery time is estimated at four to six weeks, which means that Berkman will likely be ready in time for Grapefruit League games, which begin on March 2. Originally slated to play for the U.S. in the World Baseball Classic, Berkman will not participate in the tournament. The scar tissue developed over time, after Berkman had surgery in November 2004 to repair a torn ACL, an injury he sustained during an ill-fated game of flag football. But the recent pain is a relatively new development.  \"There's always a chance after surgery that there will be scar tissue that needs to be taken off,\" said general manager Tim Purpura.  Said Berkman: \"I had discomfort after running, and it shouldn't be doing that. People may say, 'Why didn't you have this done at the end of the season?' I didn't know that I'd have to have it done.\"  Berkman missed all of Spring Training last year and a month of the season as he rehabbed his surgically repaired knee. It took him until June to regain his timing and his swing, but he isn't worried that this rehab process will take that long.  \"I probably won't go all out with games, but I won't miss any Spring Training,\" he said.
