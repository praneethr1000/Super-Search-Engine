    "body": "ARLINGTON -- The Rangers and catcher Rod Barajas avoided the arbitration process Monday, agreeing to a one-year deal worth $3.2 million.  Barajas established career highs in every offensive category in 2005, including 120 games, 410 at-bats, 53 runs scored and 104 hits. Barajas also sported a career-high .254 average with 21 home runs and 60 RBIs. Only Boston's Jason Varitek hit more home runs as a catcher in 2005, hitting 22. On defense, Barajas threw out 21 of 65 attempted basestealers, sixth among qualifying Major League catchers. He enters Spring Training as the starting catcher, while Gerald Laird will likely serve as his backup, with the possibility of starting the season at Triple-A Oklahoma. First baseman Mark Teixeira, pitchers Adam Eaton and Vicente Padilla, and outfielders Gary Matthews Jr., Kevin Mench and Brad Wilkerson are still eligible for arbitration.
