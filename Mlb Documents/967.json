    "body": "ANAHEIM -- The Angels avoided arbitration with Kole Calhoun on Tuesday night, signing their right fielder to a $3.4 million contract for 2016 and thus taking care of all their arbitration-eligible players, a source told MLB.com. Calhoun's side originally filed for $3.9 million when teams and players exchanged figures on Jan. 15, while the Angels countered at $2.35 million. The agreement is $275,000 above the midpoint and marks the fifth straight year that the Angels have avoided an arbitration hearing. â€¢ Hot Stove Tracker Pitchers Garrett Richards ($6.425 million), Hector Santiago ($5 million) and Fernando Salas ($2.4 million) previously agreed to terms. The Angels' Opening Day payroll is currently slated to be about $164 million, a figure that would represent an $18 million increase in 12 months. Calhoun, a steal in the eighth round of the 2010 Draft, has batted .263\/.316\/.435 in 286 games over the last two years, adding 43 home runs and 141 RBIs while hitting mostly in front of Mike Trout. Last year, he won his first Gold Glove Award. Alden Gonzalez is a reporter for MLB.com. Follow him on Twitter @Alden_Gonzalez and Facebook , and listen to his podcast.
