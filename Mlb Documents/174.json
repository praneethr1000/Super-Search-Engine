    "body": "MINNEAPOLIS -- 'Tis the season once again for former pitcher Bert Blyleven, and we're not talking about Christmas.  It's Hall of Fame voting season, and Blyleven, who's on the ballot for the ninth time, will have to wait and wonder as members of the Baseball Writers Association of America publicly debate his credentials and privately make their decisions.  Some are baffled why it's taken this long for Blyleven to receive enshrinement. In a career that spanned from 1970-92 with the Twins, Rangers, Pirates, Indians and Angels, he's in the top end of almost every all-time important pitching category. \"My numbers have increased slowly,\" Blyleven said. \"At least it's moving towards 75 percent and not declining.\"            Mark Sheldon is a reporter for MLB.com.
