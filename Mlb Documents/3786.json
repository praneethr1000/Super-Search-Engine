    "body": "NEW YORK -- Andy Pettitte has retained Pittsburgh-based attorney Jay Reisinger, who famously represented Sammy Sosa three years ago, for his upcoming appearance before a congressional committee.  The Yankees left-hander is one of three current or former Major League players who were summoned to testify on Jan. 16 before the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform. Roger Clemens and Chuck Knoblauch have also been invited to Washington.  The Associated Press reported Pettitte's retaining of Reisinger on Monday. Pettitte, 35, was named in former Sen. George Mitchell's Report on use of performance-enhancing drugs in baseball. Brian McNamee, a former personal trainer used by both Clemens and Pettitte, testified that Pettitte had used injections of human growth hormone.   McNamee, who worked with the Yankees in 2000 as a strength coach, and former Mets clubhouse attendant Kirk Radomski have also been asked to testify.   Last month, Pettitte admitted to using HGH twice during the 2002 season while he was rehabilitating an injury to his pitching elbow.   \"In 2002, I was injured,\" Pettitte said in a statement released by his agent, Randy Hendricks. \"I had heard that human growth hormone could promote faster healing for my elbow.   \"I felt an obligation to get back to my team as soon as possible. For this reason, and only this reason, for two days, I tried human growth hormone. Though it was not against baseball rules, I was not comfortable with what I was doing, so I stopped.   \"This is it -- two days out of my life; two days out of my entire career, when I was injured and on the disabled list. I wasn't looking for an edge. I was looking to heal.\"   In an interview with CBS' \"60 Minutes\" on Sunday, Clemens said that he was at no time aware of Pettitte's use of HGH -- a claim that could merit further examination by the congressional committee.   Clemens has repeatedly and vehemently denied allegations made by McNamee in the Mitchell Report, and he has also filed a defamation lawsuit against the former trainer in Harris County (Texas) District Court for making \"false and defamatory\" claims against the 45-year-old right-hander.      \"Andy's case is totally separate,\" Clemens told \"60 Minutes\" correspondent Mike Wallace. \"I was shocked to learn about Andy's situation. I had no idea about it.\"   The Yankees supported Pettitte's willingness to come forward with his admission. New York re-signed the hurler to a one-year, $16 million contract before the Mitchell Report was released.   Pettitte, who started his Major League career in 1995 and has also pitched for the Astros, was 15-9 with a 4.05 ERA in 36 games (34 starts) for the Yankees in '07.   Sosa was one of five current or former Major League players to testify before the congressional committee in March 2005, joining Jose Canseco, Mark McGwire, Rafael Palmeiro and Curt Schilling. Sosa -- then a member of the Orioles -- denied use of performance-enhancing drugs.   Bryan Hoch is a reporter for MLB.com.
