    "body": "CINCINNATI -- One by one, the Reds have been checking off their list of needs. Their latest move appears to have come on Monday night.  MLB.com has learned through a source that outfielder Ryan Ludwick has agreed to a one-year contract with a mutual option for 2013. The dollar figure remains unclear, but the Reds weren't expected to spend a lot to fill their opening for a fourth outfielder.  The signing is pending a physical. Although he does bat from the right side, he throws left-handed.     Mark Sheldon is a reporter for MLB.com. Read his blog, Mark My Word, and follow him on Twitter @m_sheldon.
