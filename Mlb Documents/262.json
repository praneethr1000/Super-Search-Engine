    "body": "Interest in free agent catcher Mike Piazza is picking up some steam on the Hot Stove circuit. At last count Tuesday, reports indicate that seven Major League organizations have either shown interest in the veteran receiver with 12 All-Star appearances on his resume -- or vice versa. Two published reports out of New York on Tuesday indicated that Piazza's agents contacted the Yankees on Monday, measuring the team's interest in the catcher. Exactly how receptive club officials were remains uncertain. Newsday reported that although the Yankees \"can't yet be considered aggressive pursuers\" for Piazza, general manager Brian Cashman did not dismiss the idea.   \"We're fairly set,\" Cashman said. \"Our designated hitter spot is taken by Bernie Williams and Andy Phillips. But I'll keep an open mind. I'm always open to consider any possibility that may help the ballclub.\"  But according to New York Daily News columnist Bill Madden, \"The Yankees' response was that there was no room at the inn. And, according to sources, Piazza, who hit .251 with 19 homers and 62 RBI with the Mets last year, has minimal offers to play a reserve role (elsewhere), but none of them are anywhere near his believed asking price of $7 million-$8 million a year.  \"It is the Yankees' feeling that Piazza could not offer as much in a DH capacity as what they expect to get out of Bernie Williams, and they are satisfied with Kelly Stinnett as their backup catcher.\"  ESPN reported later on Tuesday that the Phillies have shown interest in Piazza over the past few days, and discussions between the team and Piazza's agents -- the Beverly Hills Sports Council -- have been \"very preliminary,\" according to one source, and haven't specifically addressed money or Piazza's role.  Meanwhile, the Blue Jays, Padres, Orioles, Angels and Indians also are thought to have mild interest in the 37-year-old Piazza, who has a .311 career batting average, 397 home runs and 1,223 RBIs during a 16-year MLB career.  He also has some fragile legs, which has prompted some to believe Piazza would be better off ending his terrific career as a designated hitter in the American League.     In other Tuesday Hot Stove developments:  Blue Jays: The Blue Jays signed well-traveled right-hander James Baldwin to a Minor League contract and invited him to Spring Training. The 34-year-old Baldwin split time with the Orioles, Rangers and Ottawa Lynx (International League) last year.  The Southern Pines, N.C., native has spent parts of 11 seasons in the Majors with the Chicago White Sox (1995-2001), Los Angeles Dodgers (2001), Seattle Mariners (2002), Minnesota Twins (2003), New York Mets (2004), Orioles and Rangers. He has a career record of 79-74 with two saves and a 5.01 ERA.   Baldwin, the fourth-round pick of the White Sox in the 1990 First-Year Player Draft, was selected to play in the 2000 All-Star Game.   Nationals: The Nationals have expressed interest in first baseman Daryle Ward and reliever Felix Rodriguez. The team also is monitoring Ugueth Urbina's legal proceedings in Venezuela, according to a baseball source. Both Ward and Rodriguez have been offered Minor League contracts and would be invited to Spring Training as non-roster players.  Urbina, 31, currently is in a Venezuelan prison on attempted murder charges. The source said if Urbina is set free, he could be a good fit out of the bullpen for the Nationals. Urbina pitched for the Tigers and Phillies last season, going a combined 5-6 with a 3.62 ERA and 10 saves.   The Nationals are out of the running for Joey Gathright. Washington offered reliever Bill Bray, the team's first-round pick in 2004, for the outfielder, but the Devil Rays declined the offer.  Reds: One day after dismissing general manager Dan O'Brien, the Reds on Tuesday hired former Expos and Orioles GM Jim Beattie as special advisor to new owner Bob Castellini. He could be in line, perhaps, to be the organization's next full-time GM.  Reds baseball operations director Brad Kullman was named interim GM on Monday. Another potential candidate is Twins assistant GM Wayne Krivsky, a finalist for the Reds GM job when O'Brien was ultimately hired in October 2003.  Krivsky said Tuesday afternoon that Castellini had not yet contacted him, but he expressed his interest in the job. \"I'd be flattered if he does call,\" Krivsky said. \"If he calls (Twins GM) Terry Ryan to get permission, I'd be more than happy to talk to him.\"  The 51-year-old Beattie was put in charge of analyzing the baseball operations of the Reds, namely the pitching program.   \"I'm going to be here as long as Bob feels it's necessary for me to be here,\" Beattie said. \"Initially, I'm going to perform an organizational evaluation of the pitching program and the arms in place and get a sense of what the strengths and weaknesses are.\"  Kullman, meanwhile, said the trade offers have been for outfielder Austin Kearns but haven't found the right match yet.  \"I think teams feel they can get him below market value now,\" Kullman said. \"While there have been some reasonable offers, we feel that trading him now may not be what is value is once he's gets to Spring Training healthy, playing every day ... and another team has a need arise.\"  Red Sox: As speculated, the Red Sox issued a press release late Tuesday afternoon naming Theo Epstein, once again, the club's general manager. Jed Hoyer and Ben Cherington, who shared the role of GM during much of the time Epstein was away from the club, will stay on in the baseball operations department.  The Red Sox also are on the verge of introducing Alex Gonzalez as the team's new shortstop and acquiring center fielder Coco Crisp from the Indians. Multiple reports have Crisp coming to Boston along with reliever David Riske and Josh Bard to the Indians for Guillermo Mota, infielder Andy Marte and catcher Kelly Shoppach.
