    "body": "Rich Gossage didn't get in the door, again. But the \"Goose\" is toeing the threshold.  On the day a fellow reliever revelled in selection to the Hall of Fame, Goose Gossage, who threw fear into batters while Bruce Sutter was only throwing splitters at them, high-kicked his way to Cooperstown's doorsill.  With the reluctance of ballot-holding veteran baseball writers to enshrine closers gradually wearing down, it was probably unrealistic for two of them to get simultaneous nods. But there was encouragement as well as disappointment in Gossage's numbers: 336 votes, on 64.6 percent of the record 520 ballots cast. \"I don't think anybody did it the way I did it,\" Gossage recently told MLB.com's Barry M. Bloom. \"Power against power. There was no messing around. All those strikeouts I had, none of that is padding. Just about every one of them meant something because the game was on the line.\"       Tom Singer is a reporter for MLB.com.
