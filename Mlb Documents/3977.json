    "body": "BOSTON -- John Maine has signed with the Red Sox on a Minor League deal, a baseball source confirmed to MLB.com on Friday night.  The Fredericksburg Free Lance-Star of Virginia first reported the story.  \"[The Red Sox are] going to look at him out of the bullpen,\" Maine's agent Rex Gary told the newspaper. \"They know he can start, but they think he can be a heck of a reliever in the American League East.\" Maine, 30, has been out of the big leagues since 2010, when he made nine starts for the Mets. He underwent shoulder surgery that July before pitching for the Rockies' Triple-A team in 2011, posting a 7.43 ERA with two more walks (37) than strikeouts (35) in 46 innings.   Maine has had big league success in the rotation, going 15-10 with a 3.91 ERA for the 2007 Mets a season after he posted a 2.89 ERA over two playoff starts for New York. But before he was sent for surgery, Maine's relationship with New York's coaching staff appeared strained. The right-hander's velocity was down, and pitching coach Dan Warthen believed at the time that Maine wasn't being forthcoming about his condition.   \"If he's throwing that way, then there's got to be something incorrect in that arm,\" Warthen reportedly said in May 2010. \"Something's not feeling correct. John's a habitual liar in a lot of ways as far as his own health. He's a competitor and a warrior. He wants to go out there and pitch. But we have to be smart enough to realize this guy isn't right, the ball's not coming out of his hand correctly.\"   Last season, Maine left Colorado's Triple-A team in June.   \"He just needed to get away,\" Gary told the Free Lance-Star. \"[Retirement] may have been an option, but I don't think it seriously entered his mind.\"   Gary told the paper Maine had other suitors this winter, and that the Red Sox showed their interest by flying Maine to Boston.   Another pitcher signed for the Red Sox, even a low-cost one like Maine, only adds to the gaggle of arms Boston will have in camp.   The Sox have been linked to Roy Oswalt and Edwin Jackson, both free agents, but manager Bobby Valentine on Thursday night said he was already going to have trouble finding innings in Spring Training for the guys already on board -- and that was before Maine signed.
