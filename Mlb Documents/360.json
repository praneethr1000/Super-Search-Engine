    "body": "HOUSTON -- Six members of the 2005 National League champion Astros were among the 42 players named Monday to Team USA's Provisional Roster for the World Baseball Classic. Seven-time Cy Young Award winner Roger Clemens, left-handed starting pitcher Andy Pettitte, right-handed relievers Dan Wheeler and Brad Lidge, third baseman Morgan Ensberg and outfielder Lance Berkman are among those up for a roster spot. Clemens is a free agent. The five current Astros give Houston more players on the USA roster than any other Major League team. The final Team USA 30-man roster will not be determined until 24 hours prior to the start of the World Baseball Classic, which begins March 3 in Japan. Team USA opens play in the World Baseball Classic on Tuesday, March 7, at 2 p.m. ET local time against Mexico at Chase Field in Phoenix, Ariz.   Jim Molony is a reporter for MLB.com.
