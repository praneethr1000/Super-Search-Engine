    "body": "HOUSTON -- Astros pitchers Bud Norris and Wesley Wright and shortstop Jed Lowrie were among the 133 Major League players who filed for salary arbitration on Tuesday.  The players and the team have to exchange numbers by Friday, and arbitration hearings are scheduled to take place between Feb. 4 and 20. Both sides can negotiate contracts any time prior to a hearing, and the Astros are hopeful to reach negotiated settlements without a hearing.  Norris and Wright are arbitration eligible for the first time, and Lowrie for the second time. Lowrie made $1.15 million last year in his first year with Houston, and he could double his salary next season. Norris ($511,000 in '12) and Wright ($512,000) are also in line for substantial raises. Wright, 27, was 2-2 with a 3.27 a career-high 77 games last year, which led the Astros and ranked tied for sixth in the National League. His .226 batting average allowed ranked fifth in the NL among left-handed relievers.   Norris, 27, went 7-13 with a 4.65 ERA in 29 starts last year, allowing 165 hits and striking out 165 in 168 1\/3 innings. He had a 0-12, 6.34 ERA streak in 18 starts in the middle of the season while he battled injuries and inconsistencies. Norris had a 1.71 ERA at home and 6.94 on the road.   Lowrie, 28, set career highs in games (97), at-bats (340), runs (43), hits (83), home runs (16) and walks (43) despite missing 52 games with a sprained right ankle and leg injury. He wound up hitting .244 with 42 RBIs. Brian McTaggart is a reporter for MLB.com and writes an MLBlog, Tag's Lines. Follow @brianmctaggart on Twitter.
