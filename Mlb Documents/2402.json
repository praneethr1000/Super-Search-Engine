    "body": "The Orioles have reportedly come to an agreement on a one-year Minor League deal with reliever Steve Johnson, according to a report from MASN. The pact includes an invitation to Major League Spring Training. The team has not confirmed the reported agreement. The 27-year-old Baltimore native appeared in 21 games for the O's between 2012-13, compiling a 5-1 record and a 3.67 ERA. He underwent surgery early this fall to remove a bone spur from his right shoulder and has been playing catch without pain, according to the report, which also mentioned the Phillies, Mariners and Blue Jays among other teams to express interest in Johnson. Johnson spent the majority of the 2014 season at Triple-A Norfolk, posting a 7.11 ERA over 38 innings (13 appearances) while batting injury. Joey Nowak is a reporter for MLB.com.
