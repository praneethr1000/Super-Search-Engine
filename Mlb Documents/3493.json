    "body": "DENVER -- The Rockies agreed to pick up the $4.25 million 2013 option on the contract of closer Rafael Betancourt and added a club option for 2014, the club said Thursday. Betancourt, who turns 37 on April 29, is due to make $4.25 million in 2012 after turning in a dominant second half of last season and taking the Rockies' closer job in August. The right-hander finished last season 2-0 with a 2.89 ERA and eight saves. By converting eight of his nine save chances after taking over for an injured Huston Street, Betancourt made it possible for the Rockies to trade Street to the Padres for a Minor Leaguer this offseason.
