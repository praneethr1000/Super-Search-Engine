    "body": "NEW YORK -- Relief pitcher Bobby Parnell and the Mets have agreed on a one-year deal to avoid arbitration, the team announced Wednesday. Parnell will make $3.7 million, according to a source, the same salary he made in his second year of arbitration last season. Parnell, 30, threw a single inning on Opening Day 2014 before succumbing to Tommy John surgery. He missed the entire season after working his way back from a neck operation the previous winter. Prior to that, Parnell had established himself as the Mets' unquestioned closer in 2013, saving 22 games in 26 chances with a 2.16 ERA. With Parnell sidelined last year, the Mets turned to multiple potential closers, eventually settling on Jenrry Mejia. Manager Terry Collins said at the Winter Meetings that while Mejia is still essentially the ninth-inning man heading into Spring Training, Jeurys Familia and Vic Black may compete for saves as well. And when Parnell returns to full strength -- the Mets expect that to take until about May -- he should have a chance to regain his job. Parnell's signing leaves the Mets with five arbitration-eligible players: Lucas Duda, Dillon Gee, Mejia, Daniel Murphy and Ruben Tejada. If any of those five do not settle, they will officially file for arbitration and exchange salary figures with the Mets next week. Anthony DiComo is a reporter for MLB.com.
