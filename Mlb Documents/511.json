    "body": "The Boston Red Sox were hunting for a center fielder, and it couldn't be just any Johnny-come-lately. Left with a hole where Johnny Damon once stood, they needed to get a name.  Well, you've got to admit they could not have gotten a better one. Name, that is. It doesn't get cooler than Coco Crisp, who finally is on his Fenway to Boston.  But did the Red Sox also get a good baseball player, someone suited to fill the most important empty shoes in New England? Indeed. The name may be the least exciting aspect of a fleet 26-year-old outfielder just coming into his own as a hitter with thunder. Tom Singer is a reporter for MLB.com.
