    "body": "This is Fantasy Camp Part Two for me. The first camp was very enjoyable, but I missed the last day when the coaches play against the players. This one I missed the first two days, but I'm here for the rest of it. Last year my team won the championship.  Tuesday was the first day on the field. We had a practice game. My team is called the Thunder. We've got a pretty good ballclub. We're still getting the kinks out a little bit. We got our butts kicked twice Tuesday, 23-3 and 19-1. Wednesday we lost the first game, 9-4, but we're seeing some improvement every day with these guys and hopefully by Friday we'll win one or two games.  So far it has been great. It's fun anytime you can get together and share stories and talk about the old days. I can always remember one of my favorite days at Yankee Stadium was Old Timers Day. It's really a neat thing to now be a part of that and be a part of the group with these guys. There's a never-ending supply of stories when you get all these guys together. All the campers enjoy it, too. Every one of these guys is a Yankees fan and they're all around 50-60 years old so they all know all of us. It's fun to sit around the bar at night and share some of these things with them and I think that's why they enjoy this camp so much.",
