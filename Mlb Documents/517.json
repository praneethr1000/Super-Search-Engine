    "body": "PITTSBURGH -- Those who have long been clinging to the notion that Pittsburgh is not a good baseball town took one squarely on the chin Saturday.  Despite the fact that the football-crazy city is experiencing Super Bowl fever in anticipation of the Pittsburgh Steelers' showdown next week against the Seattle Seahawks, Bucs fans have flocked to PirateFest in record numbers this weekend.  Nearly 7,000 fans attended PirateFest on Saturday for the largest single-day crowd in the 16-year history of the event. And although the Steelers held a pep rally across the Allegheny River at Heinz Field on Friday during the opening night of PirateFest, Pirates management expects that the overall attendance this weekend will surpass last winter's three-day total of 14,000. \"This says so much about the City of Pittsburgh and their support of their sports teams,\" said new Pirates manager Jim Tracy, who was attending his first PirateFest. \"You have a group of people who absolutely love this team.\"   Another sign of the excitement that is building for the 2006 Pirates season, said Pirates VP of marketing and sales Tim Schuldt, has been an increase in ticket sales. The Bucs have sold hundreds of season-ticket packages already this weekend, and they are close to matching the 9,000-plus full-season ticket equivalencies that they sold in all of 2005.   While fans have no doubt been influenced to purchase season-ticket packages because the 2006 All-Star Game will be held at PNC Park, Schuldt and Pirates CEO and general managing partner Kevin McClatchy believe that there is more to it than that.   \"We're selling the heck out of [the season-ticket plans], which is terrific,\" said Schuldt. \"It tells you a lot about what these people think about the team.\"   \"A lot of people are excited about Jim Tracy and the players we have picked up,\" added McClatchy. \"The All-Star game is a bonus.\"   The renewed excitement for the team was evident throughout the David L. Lawrence Convention Center. The lines for free player autographs were exceptionally long, the live stage events were well-attended, and Pirates jerseys and t-shirts outnumbered Steelers and Penguins gear by a large margin, which is no small feat in a city where it seems that just about everyone aged 5 to 50 owns a Ben Roethlisberger, Hines Ward, Sidney Crosby or Mario Lemieux jersey.   Perhaps nowhere was the optimistic attitude of the Bucs faithful more conspicuous than during the Q&A sessions with the players, coaches and management. The sometimes contentious exchanges of the past were replaced by praise from fans for a job well done during the offseason and best wishes for a winning season in 2006.   Tracy received the biggest ovation from the crowd Friday night when he responded to a question about meeting his former employer during the home opener at PNC Park.   \"I'm looking forward to April 10 because we play the Dodgers in Pittsburgh,\" said Tracy, who managed Los Angeles from 2001-05, \"and I think we need to beat the [heck] out of them, don't you?\"   Saturday, Tracy and pitching coach Jim Colborn joined Pirates players Ryan Vogelsong, Chris Duffy, Brad Eldred, Mike Gonzalez, Kip Wells, Jason Bay, Jack Wilson and Zach Duke on stage before a standing-room only crowd. The most notable of the often lively exchanges with the fans included:   Wilson, on what the Pirates would like to achieve this season: \"We want to do what the Steelers are doing and bring a championship back to Pittsburgh.\"   Sanchez, on what it was like to hit a home run off Astros legend Roger Clemens last season: \"That was the biggest highlight of my career so far in the big leagues. It meant a lot to me, and it's something I'll never forget.\"   Bay -- a former Seattle resident and recently outed Seahawks fan -- who received both the biggest cheer and jeer from the crowd in a matter of 10 minutes, on who he'd be rooting for in the Super Bowl: \"I knew this was coming. I'm sticking to my guns. But I'm going to be happy either way.\"   Wilson, on what he thought about a woman playing for the Pirates: \"As long as she didn't play shortstop, I think it would be great.\"   Vogelsong, on who he'd most like to face in batting practice among those who were sharing the stage with him: \"Kip Wells. He thinks he can hit.\"   To which Wells responded: \"Ask [Vogelsong] how many home runs he's got!\"   And finally, Wells, on what happened to the three balls he has hit for home runs in his career: \"Two of them are in Cooperstown.\"   PirateFest 2006 continues Sunday from noon to 5 p.m. ET. Tickets are available online at pirates.com and at the Convention Center box office. Ed Eagle is a reporter for MLB.com.
