    "body": "Some of the latest players to commit to playing for Team USA in this year's World Baseball Classic include the reigning National League Cy Young Award winner, one of the game's most experienced left-handers and one of baseball's best young relievers.  R.A. Dickey, Andy Pettitte, Ryan Vogelsong and Craig Kimbrel are set to join manager Joe Torre's star-studded provisional roster that is expected to include David Wright, Giancarlo Stanton, Joe Mauer and Ryan Braun, MLB.com has confirmed from baseball sources.  Other bullpen pieces will include San Diego's Luke Gregerson, and Cleveland's Chris Perez and Vinnie Pestano. Red Sox outfielder Shane Victorino is expected to join Baltimore's Adam Jones in the outfield, with Mark Teixeira, Jimmy Rollins and Brandon Phillips joining the infield group. Justin Verlander is a possibility, but he would be a later addition. The team is also expected to carry three catchers, but the other two are still to be determined.   Other potential Team USA stars like Rockies shortstop Troy Tulowitzki and Dodgers center fielder Matt Kemp are both reportedly being held off the roster because of precautionary reasons due to injuries.
