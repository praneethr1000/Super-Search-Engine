    "body": "CLEVELAND -- The Indians are not overly concerned with Trevor Bauer's past. All Cleveland cares about is the young pitcher's future, which has the potential to be bright, given his ability to both throw a baseball and study the intricate physics behind his chosen profession.  Being traded to the Indians in December offered Bauer a clean slate. All the issues over his unique warmup routine, the reports of his inability to mesh with his Arizona teammates, the questions about his willingness to listen or try something new, it can all be pushed aside now that Cleveland is providing the prospect with a new environment.  \"If he aggravated somebody else on another team, I don't care,\" Indians manager Terry Francona said. \"He's got a fresh start.\" Jordan Bastian is a reporter for MLB.com.
