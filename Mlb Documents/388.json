    "body": "ARLINGTON -- The Rangers are beginning their Roger Clemens push and are close to agreeing with pitcher Vicente Padilla on a one-year contract.  Rangers owner Tom Hicks said Monday he is planning to send a letter to Clemens' agent, Alan Hendricks, outlining possible financial parameters to a deal and why Arlington would be a good fit for the seven-time Cy Young Award winner.  Clemens, a free agent, has yet to decide if he'll pitch this season. If he wants to keep playing, Hicks made it clear the Rangers are extremely interested. As for Padilla, the two sides made significant progress on Monday and are expected to reach an agreement as early as Tuesday. Padilla can still become a free agent after the upcoming season but a one-year deal would avoid a potential arbitration hearing.   Padilla was acquired by the Rangers on Dec. 12 from the Philadelphia Phillies for pitcher Ricardo Rodriguez. He was 9-12 with a 4.71 ERA in 27 starts for the Phillies last season.   He is part of the Rangers' revamped rotation that also includes free agent pitcher Kevin Millwood and Adam Eaton, who was acquired in a six-player trade with the San Diego Padres.   Padilla was asking for $4.8 million in arbitration and the Rangers were offering $4.1 million.   The Rangers still have two arbitration-eligible players who are unsigned: outfielders Kevin Mench and Gary Matthews Jr.   Mench is seeking $3.05 million while the Rangers are offering $2.45 million. Matthews is seeking $3 million and the Rangers are offering $2 million.   Club officials indicated at this point they have a better chance of avoiding a hearing with Mench than they do with Matthews.  T.R. Sullivan is a reporter for MLB.com.
