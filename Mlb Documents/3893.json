    "body": "NEW YORK -- The two men -- Rich \"Goose\" Gossage and Dick Williams -- can joke about it now, but it was no laughing matter during Game 5 of the World Series played between the Padres and the Tigers at Tiger Stadium on Oct. 14, 1984.  Four years before Kirk Gibson hobbled off the bench in the ninth inning at Dodger Stadium to hit his still heralded pinch-hit homer off Dennis Eckersley to win Game 1 for the Dodgers over the A's, the left-handed power hitter demolished Gossage and the Padres to end that series.  Williams was the manager and Gossage the closer on that 1984 San Diego team, and both will be inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame on July 27 in Cooperstown, N.Y. And when Williams was elected by a Veterans Committee on Dec. 4, the closer called his manager with heartfelt congratulations. Barry M. Bloom is a national reporter for MLB.com.
