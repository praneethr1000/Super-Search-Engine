    "body": "CHICAGO -- The 2011 departure of Bobby Jenks left a 173-save sized hole for the White Sox bullpen to fill.  It was a debate that played out in the court of public opinion almost from the time the White Sox non-tendered the burly right-hander. Should it be Matt Thornton, an All-Star setup man the year before, or rookie sensation Chris Sale? How about right-handers Sergio Santos or Jesse Crain, targeted more as setup men?  Well, that issue is about to take center stage once again going into Spring Training. But Matt Thornton and Addison Reed, joining Crain as the main closing candidates, aren't about to plead their respective cases through the press or start looking over their shoulders to see if the other guys are gaining ground. \"Whatever they decide to do, it's all their choice,\" said Thornton during SoxFest festivities at the Palmer House Hilton. \"Jesse was great late in the game last year. Addison Reed, he only had five or six games in the big leagues, but has great stuff and was a closer in college. It's one of those decisions where you go out, evaluate guys throughout Spring Training, and then they'll make their choice.\"   \"Honestly, I'm not saying that I'm going to be the closer,\" Reed said. \"My No. 1 goal is to make the team out of Spring Training and then whatever happens after that happens.\"   Last spring, Thornton earned the nod over Sale and then proceeded to blow four saves in his first four opportunities. That lack of success, which included some bad luck behind the hard-throwing southpaw, hasn't solely driven Thornton to want the closer's job once again. It's more about the veteran never losing belief in his ability.   \"Results weren't there with those four save opportunities, but at the same time, things didn't go my way,\" Thornton said. \"It's really out of the pitchers' hands. It's up to [White Sox manager] Robin [Ventura], [pitching coach Don] Cooper and [general manager] Kenny [Williams].   \"We went through it last year with the debate and talking about it in the offseason. But I really prepare the same way all the time.\"",
