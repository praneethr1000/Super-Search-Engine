    "body": "PHILADELPHIA -- Jimmy Rollins and Chase Utley are honored to be part of the World Baseball Classic, a 16-team tournament sanctioned by the International Baseball Federation. They don't view it as a burden at all.  \"I couldn't think of a better situation than to be able to represent your own country in an event like this,\" Utley said Tuesday as part of the Phillies' 2006 Winter Tour at Citizens Bank Park. \"Who wouldn't want to be a part of it? I'm thrilled to be on the roster. I'm looking forward to it for so many different reasons. It'll be a great experience.\"  \"It's a great event with a lot of eyes on the event,\" Rollins added. \"I'm going to give it everything I've got. I don't know if Chase and I will both play, but we'll see. It's a great reward to be part of the team.\" Utley and Rollins were named to the 60-man provisional roster for Team USA on Monday. USA Baseball announced a roster of 42 Major League players that will be eligible to compete in the tournament which will be held from March 3-20. The squad will be cut to 30 five days before the March 7 game against Mexico at Chase Field in Phoenix.   \"Jimmy and I will get time to practice together, so that's good,\" Utley said. \"Other guys could drop out of the running or decide not to play. If at all possible, I'd like to play. It would be an honor for me to go out there and represent my country in this tournament.\"   Rollins said the experience gained from a tournament like the World Baseball Classic is something that will last a long time.   \"Being involved means giving it your all and helping the team win, much like you're doing during the season with your respective team,\" Rollins said. \"The games will be competitive and intense, almost playoff-like. You'll have to be at the top of your game mentally and physically to compete.\"   Utley and Rollins could actually be competing with each other for the job at second base because Derek Jeter is expected to start at shortstop.   \"I could play there, but it would be different because I've been playing shortstop for so long,\" Rollins said. \"I'm sure Chase could give me some tips and help me out. There are so many great players who could be a part of this team that guys may be asked to play out of position.\"   Phillies manager Charlie Manuel said Utley and Rollins are definitely worthy of being part of such a select group of players.   \"Chase and Jimmy are the type of players who work so hard to improve and get better on the field,\" Manuel said. \"They strive for that. They want to get better all the time. They're fine up-and-coming players who are only going to keep getting better.\"   Other Phillies who will represent their respective countries at the WBC include Bobby Abreu and Tomas Perez (Venezuela), Rheal Cormier (Canada), Rob Tejeda and Eude Brito (Dominican Republic) and Carlos Ruiz (Panama).
