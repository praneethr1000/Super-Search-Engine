    "body": "DETROIT -- Justin Verlander told his followers on Twitter he was playing a bad round of golf when he got the call regarding the Tigers coming to terms with Prince Fielder. His game didn't get much better, but his day did.  \"The Prince news turned my day around! Still played bad, but who cares,\" Verlander tweeted. \"Really excited about 2012, especially with the new addition.\"  He wasn't the only Tigers player looking at the season with a little brighter outlook, once the sense of shock over Fielder's agreement tapered off. \"It's going to be a very interesting season. I think everybody's pumped up to get going.\"               Jason Beck is a reporter for MLB.com. Read Beck's Blog and follow him on Twitter @beckjason.
