    "body": "On Sept. 8, 1972, Tom Walker, a young relief pitcher for the young Montreal Expos, trots in from the Jarry Park bullpen to work the top of the ninth against the Pittsburgh Pirates.  A No. 1 Draft choice four years earlier by the Baltimore Orioles, the finesse right-hander retires Gene Clines on a fly to center, gets Vic Davalillo on a grounder to second and begins to work on Al Oliver, while keeping an expectant eye on the on-deck circle.  When Oliver pulls a bouncer to first to end a three-up, three-down inning, the on-deck batter starts a slow jog to right field, rather than his characteristic slow walk into the batter's box. The 23-year-old Walker strolls toward his dugout, ironically disappointed that having done his job too well ruined a meeting with immortal greatness.
