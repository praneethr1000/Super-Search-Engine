    "body": "The Nationals and right-hander Drew Storen agreed on Thursday to a one-year, $2.5 million contract, avoiding arbitration, according to a Twitter post by CAA Sports, which represents the 25-year-old reliever. Storen can also earn an additional $1 million in performance bonuses. The Nats have not commented on the agreement. Storen sat out more than half of last season after undergoing right elbow surgery in April but finished the regular season strong, posting a 2.37 ERA with four saves and 17 games finished in 30 1\/3 innings over 37 appearances. Storen's most memorable moment of the year, however, was his part in the Nationals' collapse in Game 5 of the National League Division Series, when he fell one strike short of pushing Washington into the NL Championship Series. In three Major League seasons, Storen has racked up 52 saves with a 2.96 ERA and 150 strikeouts in 161 innings over 164 games.  The right-hander became eligible for arbitration as a Super Two player, ranking among the top 22 percent in service time among players with between two and three years of service time. The previous collective bargaining agreements required a player to rank among the top 17 percent in that category to receive Super Two status.  The Nats are now left with six remaining arbitration-eligible players: outfielder Roger Bernadina, reliever Tyler Clippard, shortstop Ian Desmond, starter Ross Detwiler, reliever Craig Stammen and starter Jordan Zimmermann.
