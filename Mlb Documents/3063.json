    "body": "ARLINGTON -- Former Ranger Frank Howard spent over a half-century in baseball, and he was a coach with the Tampa Bay Devil Rays when they made Josh Hamilton the first overall pick in the 1999 First-Year Player Draft.  \"A tremendous talent,\" Howard said of Hamilton. \"Just a tremendous talent. I thought the world of Josh Hamilton. I thought he was going to be another Mickey Mantle or another Willie Mays. He could run, throw and had tremendous bat speed; he was one of these guys who come along once every 50 years in baseball. He had his setback, but God bless him. He has worked his way through it and is an outstanding ballplayer.\"  Hamilton is known mainly for his tremendous power, but there have been few in Major League history who could hit a baseball as hard or as far as Howard. An outfielder with prodigious power, Howard was the star attraction for the Rangers when they moved to Texas in 1972, and the club will recognize him as the 2011 winner of the Mark Holtz Alumni Award at its awards banquet on Thursday at the Arlington Convention Center. Howard's prime came during the pitching-dominated decade of the 1960s, and his 288 home runs in that 10-year span rank sixth behind Hall of Famers Harmon Killebrew, Hank Aaron, Mays, Frank Robinson and Willie McCovey.
