    "body": "More than a decade ago, the Giants employed a strategy they knew would make them annual favorites in the National League West and could carry them to the World Series. Its name was Barry Bonds. Now, they have another strategy, one that already has paid off with a World Series title. It's called The Game's Best Young Pitching Staff, and in an era in which pitching, not power, is king, the Giants are leaning on their stellar arms as heavily as they ever did on Bonds' bat. Which is why the Giants' course of offseason business, or lack thereof, shouldn't come as much of a surprise. Their pitching staff, the best in the Majors' last year, and what carried them to glory, is intact. So when the Giants mount their first defense of a World Series title since 1955, three years before they arrived in San Francisco, they'll be doing it with almost the same roster they had when they painted October orange.  Call it resting on one's laurels, or call it wisely refraining from fixing what ain't broke. Whatever it's called, the team everybody in the NL West will be trying to knock off the pedestal in 2011 looks almost identical to the team that won the division on the very last day of the season in 2010.  Will that be enough to repeat as division champs? The Giants are confident it will be, thanks largely to Tim Lincecum, Brian Wilson and Co.  \"I think legitimately we can start the season saying that our goal is to win the division,\" general manager Brian Sabean said as he reached the Winter Meetings in December with virtually no agenda. \"We should be in a position to be favored to do that. We have to live up to that.\"  Sabean knows well from the Bonds years that there is a time frame when a team's cornerstone is in its prime, and that time is now with this talented and deep pitching staff in place.  \"We hope we're in a window, much like we were during the Bonds era, where we put together some good teams,\" Sabean said. \"Unfortunately, in that case, we went to only one World Series [in 2002] and didn't win it.  \"But at this place and time, because of the pitching and how we can, at least in the foreseeable near future, control the roster, there's a lot of excitement about what the possibilities are.\"  For the Giants, it used to be a matter of how to surround Bonds -- either by protecting him in the lineup (e.g. Jeff Kent), or providing enough pitching (e.g. Jason Schmidt). The Giants won the division three times and a Wild Card once among five second-place finishes in the heyday of the \"Bonds window,\" from 1997-2004.  Now, it's a matter of keeping a perfect storm of talent, service time and opportunity on as long a roll as possible.  This winter, that meant standing pat.  They parted ways with veteran infielders Juan Uribe and Edgar Renteria, the World Series MVP, and brought in Miguel Tejada to fill some of that void. That, along with signing eight arbitration-eligible players -- including October hero Cody Ross and breakout leadoff man Andres Torres -- closed the book on the Giants this offseason.  Lincecum, Matt Cain, Jonathan Sanchez and Madison Bumgarner, as well as veteran Barry Zito, all are under club control through 2012 or beyond, so their starting pitching remains a huge asset. Coupled with a bullpen that proved both effective and versatile under pressure, the Giants led the Majors with a 3.36 ERA during the 2010 regular season.  At the plate, the Giants are hoping for the good to continue (Aubrey Huff, Buster Posey), the off to be back on again (Pablo Sandoval, Mark DeRosa) and newly acquired Tejada to bring what Uribe did at the plate and what Renteria did in the field.  Will that be enough in what is always a fascinating, entertaining division? The NL West has seen all five of its members reach the postseason in the past five years. It is a division that saw the Padres surrender a double-digit lead to the Giants last year. It is a division that always has something up its sleeve -- be it the Padres' 2010 surge or the Rockies' recent late-season runs.  For their part, the Rockies made their biggest news internally this winter, first extending shortstop Troy Tulowitzki's contract to pay him $157.75 million over the next 10 seasons and then wrapping up slugger Carlos Gonzalez with a seven-year, $80 million deal. They also kept lefty Jorge De La Rosa around in a talented rotation led by Ubaldo Jimenez, and added outside help in utility man Ty Wigginton and fireballer Matt Lindstrom.  They, too, see a window of having explosive young talent in the fold, and they're hoping to turn it into some hardware, just like the Giants did this past autumn.  \"Tulo is a really good young player, too, and we're growing together, learning together how to play this game,\" Gonzalez said upon signing his big-bucks contract. \"We have the same purpose, too. We want to win the World Series.\"  The Dodgers, who endured their first losing season in five years, had a short to-do list. They wrapped up lefty Ted Lilly with a three-year deal as part of sewing up essentially the same rotation as last year, and aside from taking Uribe from the Giants and starter Jon Garland from the Padres also signed catcher Rod Barajas and a number of depth-providing players.  The Padres suffered the biggest offseason loss of the bunch in trading away Adrian Gonzalez, but the staff that was second only to the Giants in the Majors with a 3.41 ERA is back. The Padres' main course of business was to improve up the middle with the acquisitions of center fielder Cameron Maybin and shortstop Jason Bartlett and the signing of second baseman Orlando Hudson. With that, the Padres will rely heavily on pitching and defense once again.  And after the D-backs slipped to a 97-loss season, new GM Kevin Towers -- an NL West veteran with 14 previous seasons as GM in San Diego -- took on the team's pitching staff as his first project.  \"If you want to compete in that division, you're going to have to pitch,\" Towers said. \"If you look at our moves, most of our moves have been either bullpen or starting pitching. For us to get better and compete with the San Franciscos, we need to pitch with them.\"  That's essentially the challenge the Giants are posing to the rest of the NL West with their offseason of small change and a mound of confidence in their arms:  Pitch with us.
