    "body": "BOSTON -- For weeks, Red Sox president\/CEO Larry Lucchino promised that the light would be left on and the door would be kept ajar in the event that Theo Epstein opted to return to the club. After weeks of speculation, that exact scenario unfolded, with the Red Sox releasing a brief statement Thursday night saying simply that Epstein, who departed his post as general manager on Oct. 31, will return to the organization.  What role will Epstein play now that his confidants -- Ben Cherington and Jed Hoyer -- are co-general managers? That will be elaborated on next week, when the Red Sox hold a formal news conference to shed light on Epstein's return to the organization.  Epstein's new role figures to have plenty of significance, as the club did indicate he would be returning to the club full-time, and not, as had been speculated in some circles, in an advisory role. The Red Sox issued a joint statement Thursday night on behalf of principal owner John W. Henry, chairman Tom Werner, Lucchino and Epstein:   \"As you know, we have spoken frequently during the last 10 weeks. We have engaged in healthy, spirited debates about what it will take over the long-term for the Red Sox to remain a great organization and, in fact, become a more effective organization in philosophy, approaches and ideals. Ironically, Theo's departure has brought us closer together in many respects, and, thanks to these conversations, we now enjoy the bonds of a shared vision for the organization's future that did not exist on October 31. With this vision in place, Theo will return to the Red Sox in a full-time baseball operations capacity, details of which will be announced next week.\"   The reasons for Epstein's initial departure were never clear, mainly because Epstein chose to keep them personal.   Just as Lucchino began opening the door for speculation that Epstein could return, the former GM also seemed open to the possibility.   \"It was flattering that Larry said he left the light on for me,\" Epstein said on Jan. 7. \"But as I said at the time, I left for reasons, and as I said in the press conference when I left, it's a long life, and if those things change and the situation is different, maybe at some point later on, it would be possible for me to return to the Red Sox.\"   That time is now, with roughly a month until Spring Training begins.   Epstein's transition back to the organization figures to be seamless in that he's kept in close contact with Cherington, Hoyer, Henry and others since opting not to accept the club's offer for a contract extension on Halloween.   Epstein, in tandem with Hoyer and Cherington, will patch the remaining holes for the 2006 club. And Hoyer and Cherington figure to have no qualms with that arrangement, as, on the day they were promoted to their new capacities, both men were honest in saying they'd love to see Epstein return.   There will be plenty of work to keep everyone busy.   Center field has been vacant since Johnny Damon left for the Yankees just before Christmas. Shortstop is also a question mark, but Alex Cora, a utility player last year, might take over.   And there are still trade requests pending from Manny Ramirez and David Wells.   During Epstein's watch as general manager, which began on Nov. 25, 2002, the Red Sox won the World Series for the first time in 86 years. They also qualified for postseason play three times in a row for the first time in franchise history.   With Epstein back on board, the Red Sox will try to keep that run going.   \"Our job is to put the strongest baseball team together, and that starts with as strong as possible front office, and as strong as possible baseball operations department,\" Lucchino said on Dec. 12. \"Theo is an immensely talented guy who has proved himself over the last several years here. If he is comfortable and happy and feels he could be productive in this organization, in this structure, we would welcome it.\" Ian Browne is a reporter for MLB.com.
