    "body": "LOS ANGELES -- The Dodgers announced Monday the signings of four players from the Dominican Republic by the club's revamped international scouting department.  Signed were outfielders Deivy Castillo and Ariel Sandoval; shortstop Ravel Hernandez; and right-handed pitcher Miguel Urena. Each player is 17 years old.  Sandoval reportedly received a $150,000 signing bonus. The signings are the first for the Dodgers since the arrival of Bob Engle and several scouts that worked with him in Seattle. Management has been outspoken about the club's aggressive return to international scouting after virtually abandoning emerging markets for most of the past decade.
