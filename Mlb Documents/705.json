    "body": "The Hot Stove ignited Wednesday when Alex Gordon returned to the Royals in a move that could have an impact moving forward on the markets for fellow outfielders Yoenis Cespedes and Justin Upton. Here's a look at the latest rumors floating around the big leagues: Latest on Cespedes, Upton The Orioles have been in contact with representatives for both Cespedes and Upton, according to ESPN's Buster Olney. The Rangers have also shown interest in Upton, according to FOX Sports' Ken Rosenthal. Texas is said to prefer a one-year deal for Upton, but could offer a multiyear contract for the right price. However, Upton plans to continue exploring the open market in hopes of securing a longer deal, according to Rosenthal. Meanwhile, the Orioles' interest in Upton is a fallback option in case Chris Davis signs elsewhere, according to FOX Sports' Jon Morosi. Maeda deal nearing completion The Dodgers are expected to announce the signing of Japanese right-hander Kenta Maeda during a news conference scheduled for 1 p.m. PT on Thursday. The contract is said to be for eight years with at least $24 million guaranteed, in addition to performance bonuses. The Dodgers were reportedly concerned about the long-term durability of Maeda's elbow, leading to an incentive-laden deal. Maeda was posted by the Hiroshima Carp, who will reportedly receive a posting fee of $20 million from the Dodgers. Royals interested in Kennedy  The Royals have strong interest in Ian Kennedy, according to MLB Network's Jon Heyman, and they are expected to make a push to sign the right-hander now that they have re-signed Gordon. Kansas City is also said to be looking into Wei-Yin Chen and Yovani Gallardo. All three starting pitchers declined qualifying offers this offseason and are thus tied to Draft-pick compensation. Marlins fielding calls on Ozuna The Marlins are listening to trade proposals for outfielder Marcell Ozuna, but the club has no urgency to strike a deal unless it receives a substantial return, reports MLB.com's Joe Frisaro. The Marlins are said to be seeking big league talent and prospects in any potential deal for Ozuna, who is not eligible for free agency until 2020. The market on Ozuna is \"moving fast\" and includes one team from the West Coast, according to Yahoo! Sports. The Rangers are also reportedly holding \"trade discussions\" with the Marlins, per USA Today. Trade speculation has surrounded Ozuna since last July and roughly 10 teams expressed interest in the 25-year-old during the Winter Meetings last month. Lincecum to hold showcase Tim Lincecum plans to hold a showcase in Arizona for interested teams later this month or in early February, according to ESPN's Jerry Crasnick. Lincecum, 31, is recovering from September hip surgery. In 15 starts with the Giants last season before being injured, the right-hander went 7-4 with a 4.13 ERA over 76 1\/3 innings.
