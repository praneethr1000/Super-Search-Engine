    "body": "CLEVELAND -- Danny Graves sat in the Indians clubhouse Friday and sized it up in his head. He noticed a few slight differences in the place since he had last occupied it in 1997. A missing ping-pong table here, a new couch there. Overall, though, it looked very much the same. It was the differences in himself, Graves thought, that were really striking.
