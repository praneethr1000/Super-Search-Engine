    "body": "CINCINNATI -- Looking to supplement their rotation with extra depth, the Reds reached a Minor League deal late Wednesday with left-handed pitcher Jeff Francis, according to CBSSports.com.  Reds general manager Walt Jocketty told MLB.com last week that his club was interested in adding Francis, a free agent.  Francis, 30, was 6-16 with a 4.82 ERA in 31 starts last season with the Royals. Most of his career had been spent with the Rockies from 2004-10. He was a 17-game winner in 2007.
