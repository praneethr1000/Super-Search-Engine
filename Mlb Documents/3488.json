    "body": "Craig Counsell will enter his role as a special advisor in the Brewers' front office having proved to be a consummate professional over parts of 16 seasons in the bigs. And he has the distinction of being part of two dramatic Game 7 rallies in the World Series. But Counsell holds a much more meaningful distinction to former Major League coach Rich Donnelly. To him, Counsell was, and forever is, \"The Chicken.\" And while the nickname might sound silly, its significance to Donnelly and his family is anything but.
