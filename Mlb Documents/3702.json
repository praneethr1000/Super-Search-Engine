    "body": "DENVER -- The Rockies and center fielder Dexter Fowler avoided arbitration on Tuesday by agreeing to a one-year contract, the club said. The club did not release a figure, but the MLB Trade Rumors website placed the value at $2.35 million. Fowler was the only arbitration-eligible player the club dealt with on Tuesday, the deadline to tender contracts to players who are eligible for arbitration. The Rockies already avoided arbitration with Kevin Slowey, signing him to a one-year, $2.75 million deal after acquiring him in a trade with the Twins. The club signed outfielder Seth Smith on Sunday for one year and $2.415 million, before trading him to the Athletics on Monday. Earlier in the offseason, Colorado traded third baseman Ian Stewart to the Cubs and non-tendered outfielder Ryan Spilborghs.  Fowler, 25, tied career highs in batting average (.266) and on-base percentage (.363), although he struggled early and got hot after returning from a demotion to Triple-A Colorado Springs. He also knocked 15 triples and 35 doubles. The Rockies are expecting a breakout season from Fowler in 2012. Thomas Harding is a reporter for MLB.com.
