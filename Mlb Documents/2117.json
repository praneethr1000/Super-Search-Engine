    "body": "DENVER -- The Rockies avoided arbitration with three players on Wednesday by reaching one-year agreements with right-handed pitcher Jordan Lyles and outfielder Drew Stubbs, and reaching a two-year deal with right-hander Tyler Chatwood, who could miss most or all of the 2015 season as he recovers from elbow surgery. The club did not reveal contract terms, but Major League sources place the Lyles deal at $2,475,000, as first reported by CBS Sports, and the Stubbs contract at $5,825,000. Chatwood's contract will pay him $1 million in 2015 and the same salary in 2016. ESPN first reported Chatwood can earn up to an additional $250,000 in 2016 based on games started. The agreements leave the Rockies with five arbitration-eligible players -- right-handed pitchers Jhoulys Chacin and Adam Ottavino, catchers Wilin Rosario and Michael McKenry and left-handed pitcher Rex Brothers. None is expected to end up with a multiyear deal. Teams and unsigned arbitration-eligible players are scheduled to exchange figures on Friday. If agreements aren't reached, hearings to determine the player's 2015 salary will take place between Feb. 1-21. Chatwood, 25, was 1-0 with a 4.50 ERA in four starts last season before being placed on the disabled list on April 30 with a right elbow injury. He had Tommy John surgery in July. The righty is 14-11 with one save and a 4.05 ERA in 43 games (36 starts) -- and 9-4 with a 3.74 ERA in 18 starts at Coors Field -- since joining the Rockies for the 2012 season. Chatwood, who pitched for the Angels in '11, will begin next season on the disabled list as he continues his recovery and rehab. This is his second year of arbitration eligibility. Lyles, 24, went 7-4 with a 4.33 ERA in 22 starts in 2014, a season interrupted by the fractured left hand he suffered in June. Lyles has started 20 or more games each of the last three seasons, the first two with the Astros. This is his first year of arbitration eligibility. Stubbs, 30, played in 130 games in '14, mostly in center field, and established career highs in batting average (.289), on-base percentage (.339), slugging percentage (.482) and OPS (.821). A right-handed hitter, Stubbs was sixth in the National League in batting average against left-handed pitchers at .328, with seven homers and 17 RBIs. This is his third year of arbitration eligibility. Thomas Harding is a reporter for MLB.com.
