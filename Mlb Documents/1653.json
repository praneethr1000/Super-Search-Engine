    "body": "MIAMI -- Two of the top prospects in baseball will get their first taste of big league Spring Training when the Marlins open camp on Feb. 12. The Marlins on Monday announced that outfielder Christian Yelich and right-hander Jose Fernandez are among 31 non-roster invitees who will be attending Spring Training. Yelich and Fernandez are Miami's top two prospects; each is expected to open the regular season at Double-A Jacksonville. Yelich was the team's first-round pick in 2010; Fernandez went in the first round in 2011. Thirty-one non-roster invitees will be in Marlins camp, and 71 players overall. Along with Yelich and Fernandez, the Marlins have invited homegrown picks Adam Conley, Andrew Heaney and Jacob Realmuto to Spring Training. Jake Marisnick, an outfield prospect acquired from the Blue Jays, also will be in camp. Miami has also announced the signings of John Maine, Chad Qualls, Kevin Slowey, Matt Downs, Nick Green and Austin Kearns to Minor League deals with Spring Training invites.
