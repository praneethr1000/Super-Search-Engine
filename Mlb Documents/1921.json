    "body": "In his 15th and final year of eligibility, former Yankees great first baseman and current Dodgers manager Don Mattingly fell well short of election to the Hall of Fame. In results that were revealed on Tuesday, Mattingly received 50 votes or 9.1 percent of the 549 ballots cast. Candidates must receive 75 percent of the vote from Baseball Writers' Association of America members to gain election to the National Baseball Hall of Fame. The outcome was a slight improvement from 2014, when Mattingly appeared on 8.2 percent of ballots cast. His best vote total was 28 percent in 2001, his first year on the ballot. Four players were elected this year: Randy Johnson, Pedro Martinez, John Smoltz and Craig Biggio. Mattingly played his entire 14-year career with the Yankees from 1982-95 and batted .307\/.358\/.471 lifetime with 222 home runs and 1,099 RBIs. A six-time All-Star -- all from 1984-89 -- Mattingly averaged 27 home runs and 114 RBIs while batting .327. Back injuries slowed Mattingly's production in the latter portion of his career and he also appeared in the postseason just once overall, in 1995. Mattingly's future chances of being enshrined in Cooperstown would rest on his candidacy on the Veterans Committee ballot. After several years of coaching in both New York and Los Angeles, Mattingly became the Dodgers' manager in 2011. He has a 354-293 record with two first-place finishes.
