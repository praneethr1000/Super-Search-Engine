    "body": "ARLINGTON -- The Rangers acquired infielder Brandon Snyder from the Orioles for cash considerations on Tuesday. He is primarily a first baseman, but the right-handed hitter can also play third and catcher. He was selected as a catcher as the 13th overall pick in the 2005 First-Year Player Draft.  Snyder played 16 games with the Orioles over the past two seasons and is 9-for-33 (.273) with no home runs and four RBIs. He played 114 games at Triple-A Norfolk last season and hit .261 with 21 doubles, 14 home runs and 71 RBIs in 114 games. He has a career Minor League on-base percentage of .332 and a .432 slugging percentage.  The Rangers now have 38 players on their 40-man roster. Nelson spent last season at Triple-A Round Rock and batted .281 with 28 doubles, 24 home runs and 83 RBIs in 121 games. He played 28 games in the Majors with the Brewers from 2008-09.",
