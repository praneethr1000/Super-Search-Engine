    "body": "WASHINGTON -- The Nationals agreed to terms on 2008 contracts on Friday with infielders Kory Casto, Josh Whitesell and Matt Whitney, pitchers Ross Detwiler, John Lannan, Garrett Mock and Chris Schroder and outfielder Lastings Milledge.  Of the players signed, Lannan, Milledge and Schroder are expected to have immediate impacts on the Nationals in 2008. Lannan was one of the Nationals' top prospects last year, and the team is looking for him to be part of the starting rotation. In 2007, he won 14 games in the Minor Leagues and impressed the Nationals by going 2-2 with a 4.15 ERA in his short stint in the big leagues.  Milledge, who was acquired from the Mets in November, is expected to be the starting center fielder. The Nationals are hoping that he will be a middle-of-the-order bat in the future. Milledge will make $402,500 if he makes the Major League club and $145,075 if he goes to the Minor Leagues. Schroder has already made his mark with the Nationals. As a reliever in 2007, Schroder had a 3.18 ERA and struck out 43 batters in 45 1\/3 innings.   Casto, Whitesell, Whitney and Mock have been invited to the big league camp for Spring Training.
