    "body": "Howie Koplitz, who pitched for the Tigers and the Senators in the 1960's and struck out Hall of Famer Carl Yastrzemski as the first Major League hitter he faced, passed away in his hometown of Oshkosh, Wis., on Monday. He was 73.  Funeral services will be held at 1 p.m. CT on Friday at the First Lutheran English Church in Oshkosh, where Koplitz worked for the United States Post Office for 38 years after his retirement from baseball. He also coached baseball at the American Legion and Oshkosh-Lourdes High School.  Oshkosh, led by legendary high school coach Harlan Quandt, is known for having a long and proud baseball heritage, and Koplitz was one of several pitchers from that town who made it to the Major Leagues. He combined to pitch a no-htitter in the 1954 Wisconsin state high school tournament that was won by Oshkosh. T.R. Sullivan is a reporter for MLB.com.
