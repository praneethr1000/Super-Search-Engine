    "body": "Free-agent infielder Yuniesky Betancourt inked a one-year contract with the Orix Buffaloes of Japan's Nippon Professional Baseball on Tuesday, according to FOXSports.com. Betancourt, who spent last season with Milwaukee, is a career .261 hitter with 80 home runs over his nine big league seasons. He struggled mightily with the Brewers last year, posting career lows with a .212 batting average and a .595 OPS. Betancourt's departure takes a versatile infielder off the free-agent market. He has played at least 60 games at all four infield positions during the course of his career. Signed by the Mariners in 2005, Betancourt spent five seasons with Seattle before being traded to Kansas City in '09. A year later, Betancourt was shipped to Milwaukee as part of the deal that netted the Brewers Zack Greinke. AJ Cassavell is a reporter for MLB.com. Follow him on Twitter @ajcassavell.
