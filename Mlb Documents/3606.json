    "body": "The Mariners are a team that could use more offense. There has been no secret about that, and they acquired a big bat this week when they traded for catcher Jesus Montero from the Yankees.  The Mariners' need for offense also led to speculation that they might give serious pursuit to free-agent first baseman Prince Fielder. But that never materialized and Fielder is headed for the Tigers after agreeing to a nine-year, $214 million contract on Tuesday.  The Mariners and Fielder were probably never a good match at this point. The Mariners are relentlessly rebuilding around some of the best young pitching in the game, they play in a ballpark that is extremely pitcher friendly and Fielder, who lives in Florida, made no secret of his desire to play for a team that is playoff-ready. At this point, he had a much better chance of leading the league in walks rather than home runs if asked to hit cleanup in the Mariners lineup. Pitching is still the Mariners' strength, with Felix Hernandez and Blake Beavan at the Major League level, Taijuan Walker, Danny Hultzen and James Paxton leading a strong group in the Minor Leagues and Hector Noesi being included in the deal with the Yankees for Michael Pineda.
