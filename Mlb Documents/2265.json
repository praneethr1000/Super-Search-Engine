    "body": "The Yankees made three personnel moves on Sunday, hiring a pair of hitting coaches and an infield coach, according to the YES Network. The club did not confirm the hirings. The club has reportedly hired Jeff Pentland as the main hitting coach to replace Kevin Long, who was let go following this past season. Pentland will be joined by Alan Cockrell, who will serve in a newly created assistant-hitting-coach role. New York also added Joe Espada as its new infield coach, replacing Mick Kelleher. As for Pentland, the 68-year-old has a lengthy Major League resume that most recently includes serving as the Marlins' hitting coordinator in 2014. He's worked as a hitting coach for five other big league teams, last holding that title in 2011 with the Dodgers. Cockrell, meanwhile, served as the Mariners' hitting coach for parts of two seasons in 2009-10 and held the same position with the Rockies in the two seasons prior to his stint in Seattle. Though a number of teams across the Majors use multiple hitting coaches, this marks the first time in franchise history that the Yankees have taken this approach.
