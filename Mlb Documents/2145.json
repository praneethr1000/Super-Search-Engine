    "body": "The American League was on a roll going into the 1992 All-Star Game. The AL, after having been dominated for more than two decades in the Midsummer Classic, had won four in a row and that winning streak was extended in the last All-Star Game played in San Diego. In the '92 game, there were 59,372 in attendance at Jack Murphy Stadium and they were still getting settled when the AL scored four runs in the first inning on their way to a 13-6 victory over the National League in the 63rd Midsummer Classic. For the first time since that night, San Diego will host the All-Star Game in 2016, Major League Baseball announced Thursday. It will mark the first Midsummer Classic at Petco Park and the third in San Diego. Along with '92, San Diego hosted in 1978. All-Star Game FAQ's Tom Glavine, who was inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame last summer, started for the NL in '92, but the AL batted around against the Braves left-hander. Glavine, the reigning NL Cy Young Award winner, started the inning by getting Roberto Alomar on a grounder to second base. Then he gave up seven straight singles that brought home four runs. Glavine was able to get a second out when Cal Ripken was thrown out by Padres hometown hero Tony Gwynn trying to stretch a single into a double. Glavine finally got out of the inning by striking out Kevin Brown, the Rangers right-hander who was the AL's starting pitcher. Brown ended up getting the win. The 13 runs ended up being tied for the most by one team in an All-Star Game. The AL also scored 13 runs in '83 and again in '98. They also finished with 19 hits, including three by Ken Griffey Jr. Those three hits included a home run and a double as Griffey was selected as the game's Most Valuable Player in his third All-Star appearance. Gywnn ended up 0-for-2, but the Padres fans had plenty to cheer about that night. Gwynn was one of five Padres to play, along with catcher Benito Santiago, third baseman Gary Sheffield, first baseman Fred McGriff and shortstop Tony Fernandez. Gwynn, McGriff and Santiago were all in the starting lineup. The Padres were also represented by trainer Bob Day. Mark McGwire, who is from Southern California, stole the show the night before by winning the Home Run Derby while over 100,000 people attended FanFest at the San Diego Convention Center. T.R.
