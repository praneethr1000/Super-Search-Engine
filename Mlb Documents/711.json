    "body": "The Yankees on Friday acquired right-hander Kirby Yates from the Indians for cash considerations. The 28-year-old reliever had been designated for assignment on Tuesday, when the Tribe formally announced the signing of first baseman Mike Napoli. â€¢ Hot Stove Tracker In 57 career appearances, all with Tampa Bay, Yates has fanned 63 in 56 1\/3 innings, but he has been hampered by the long ball. He has allowed 14 homers -- including 10 in 20 1\/3 innings last season -- while holding right-handed hitters to a .238 average. Signed by the Rays in 2009 as an undrafted free agent, Yates has recorded 69 saves while pitching to a 2.67 ERA in seven Minor League seasons. This marked the second time this offseason Yates moved in a cash transaction following his designation for assignment. Cleveland acquired him in that manner from Tampa Bay on Nov. 20. The Yanks placed Yates on their 40-man roster, which now stands at 38. Tom Singer is a reporter for MLB.com and writes an MLBlog Change for a Nickel. He can also be found on Twitter @Tom_Singer.
