    "body": "SEATTLE -- Center fielder Franklin Gutierrez has wrapped up his Venezuelan Winter League season, and the Mariners will be thrilled if he can carry his success there over into Spring Training next month in Arizona.  Gutierrez put up torrid numbers in his last four games for Leones del Caracas, batting .474 (9-for-17) with two doubles, two home runs and 10 RBIs between Dec. 18-21.  The native of Venezuela was 8-for-15 in his final three games, closing out with a 3-for-6 outing with four RBIs against Magallanes. He hit a grand slam two days earlier against Margarita in a 3-for-4 game that included five RBIs. Greg Johns is a reporter for MLB.com.
