    "body": "The Reds outrighted right-hander Josh Hancock to Triple-A Louisville on Thursday and invited him to big-league Spring Training camp.  The club had designated Hancock for assignment last week, when the team signed free agent Grant Balfour.  Hancock spent the vast majority of 2005 rehabbing a right groin strain suffered during Spring Training. With a couple rehab setbacks under his belt, he didn't return to the Reds until Sept. 1. Hancock, whom the Reds acquired from the Phillies in the 2004 Todd Jones trade, went 1-0 with a 1.93 ERA in 11 appearances last season. Anthony Castrovince is a reporter for MLB.com.
