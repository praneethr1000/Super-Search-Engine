    "body": "WASHINGTON -- The Nationals have signed right-hander Evan Meek to a Minor League contract with an invitation to big league Spring Training. Meek could bring bullpen depth to the organization. Meek, 31, spent most of last season at the Orioles' Triple-A affiliate in Norfolk, where he had a 1.94 ERA and 16 saves in 39 games. However, Meek, is best remembered for his five years with the Pirates. His best year was in 2010, when he had a 2.14 ERA and four saves and earned a spot on the National League All-Star team.
