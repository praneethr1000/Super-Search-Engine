    "body": "PASADENA, Calif. -- The Dodgers got the new year and their 50th anniversary celebration off to a rousing start as players past and present joined employees on the organization's first-ever float down Colorado Boulevard in the 119th annual Tournament of Roses Parade.  With the 350-member Los Angeles Unified All-District High School Marching Band all wearing Dodgers hats as they led the way for the float titled \"Celebrating America's Favorite Pastime,\" more than 500,000 people lined the 5 1\/2-mile parade route. They cheered the float with its 35-foot Dodgers player swinging for the fences.  \"This is a first for sure and I think I'll enjoy every minute of it,\" Dodger broadcasting legend Vin Scully, set for his 59th season with the team, said before the parade kicked off. \"I do remember riding in victory parades in Brooklyn and here in Los Angeles. Opening Day in a parade was a memorable moment when we first came out here and I broadcast the Rose Parade one year with [actress] Elizabeth Montgomery, God rest her soul. And this will be a first, riding the floral display of the Dodgers and I'm really looking forward to it.\" Ben Platt is a national correspondent for MLB.com.
