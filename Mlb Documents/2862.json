    "subtitle": "",
    "body": "The Cardinals and infielder Daniel Descalso agreed on Wednesday to a 2014 contract for $1.29 million, avoiding arbitration. Descalso was the final arbitration-eligible player for the Cards, who earlier had reached agreements on one-year contracts with outfielders Jon Jay ($3.25 million) and recently acquired Peter Bourjos ($1.2 million). \"We are pleased to have reached an agreeable resolution with Daniel and we are looking forward to the start of Spring Training,\" said Cardinals general manager John Mozeliak. The defensively-smooth and versatile Descalso, who has spent the majority of his playing time at three different positions each of the last three seasons, had filed a request for $1.65 million for arbitration purposes, which the club had countered with an offer of $930,000. The agreement, thus, is at the precise midpoint between the two numbers. Tom Singer is a reporter for MLB.com and writes an MLBlog Change for a Nickel. He can also be found on Twitter @Tom_Singer.
