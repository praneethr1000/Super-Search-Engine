    "body": "The late Dr. Benjamin Elijah Mays knew the power of words. As a pastor and then a teacher, he became a giant in the field of education, primarily through his work as president of Morehouse College, where he was called the \"spiritual mentor\" and \"intellectual father\" to one of the school's most distinguished graduates, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Mays would have been proud of what took place Monday morning in the gymnasium of the high school that bears his name. It was there that the Braves Country Caravan pulled in and players Michael Bourn, Freddie Freeman and Eric O'Flaherty, bench coach Carlos Tosca, current Braves broadcaster and Hall of Fame pitcher Don Sutton and former Braves pitcher Greg McMichael talked to a group of around 100 baseball and softball players from Mays, Therrell and South Atlanta high schools.  Baseball was the common thread and popular topic of conversation, but there were plenty of life lessons taught in the hour-plus session.  \"I suggest you look in history books and look up the man your school is named after,\" said Sutton in his opening remarks prior to introducing the Braves to the kids.   The groups were then split up and rotated into four stations. Freeman spoke at one, Bourn at one, Sutton and McMichael manned one and O'Flaherty and Tosca ran the other.  Each speaker offered his own special words of advice. Freeman talked about everything from the mechanics of hitting to proper footwork at the plate and how he learned, through perseverance, the proper footwork at first base after having spent most of his youth at third base and shortstop.  Freeman talked about learning from his mistakes -- mentioning a baserunning blunder last year that led to a stern lecture, then a calmer strategic sit-down with veteran Chipper Jones.   By the end of the session, the three boys -- who asked the majority of the mechanical questions -- and 12 girls, who warmed up and began to chime in, hung on his every word.  \"I love this. It's nice to give back to the kids,\" said Freeman. \"When I was a kid -- I grew up in California -- the Angels did stuff like this. It's always nice to see big league players. It's a little bit of an inspiration.  \"I just tell them the truth. School's very important. If you do well in school, it's going to translate to your athletics. So work hard in everything you do, and it will transfer over to everything you want.\"  Unlike Freeman, Bourn never had this kind of access growing up in Houston. It made being part of Monday's event extra special.  \"We didn't have professional athletes come and talk to us,\" Bourn said. \"It's good to be able to come in and be one and talk to some kids.   \"You never know who you're going to influence. It's hard to get the whole crowd to listen, but you may get one or two who remember what you said and carry it on in life. So you never know who you can change. Sometimes five or 10 words can make one person change their mind about something, and that can help them through who knows how many obstacles. ... You don't know what you can do for people just by saying something to them.\"  Bourn talked to the kids about his rigid routine, during the offseason and on game day, the butterflies he gets prior to every game -- \"I don't feel right if I don't have some kind of butterflies,\" he said -- and the benefits of proper nutrition, something that wasn't a priority for him growing up, but one he's making a priority for his son.  He issued a tongue-in-cheek challenge to one group.  \"I'm missing today [with my personal trainer] to talk to you,\" he said, then smiled. \"Some of you guys better get to the Majors.\"   Obviously, not all of the kids will be Major Leaguers. What to do in that case was an important part of McMichael and Sutton's message.  McMichael, who pitched eight seasons in the Majors -- five of them in Atlanta -- and is in his third year as the team's senior adviser for alumni relations, reinforced the idea that kids can take the lessons they've learned on the field and use it throughout their lives in all situations.   He especially talked about how the passion that drives them on the field never has to go away.  \"The average playing career is 3 1\/2 years,\" McMichael said. \"You might think that you're going to the Olympics and have a long career, but some day it's going to end. Take that passion that you use in sports, take what you've learned from athletics -- like how to handle failure -- and take it throughout your life.\"   He also talked about the importance of bouncing ideas off others, being around people who have your best at heart, and most important, always have \"a Plan B.\"  Sutton, who pitched in the Majors for 23 seasons (1966-88) and will begin his 23rd season in his second career behind the microphone, said that each of them can see a key to success staring back at them in the mirror every morning.  \"You are the most important gift you have,\" said the 1998 Hall of Fame inductee. \"Treat yourself with respect. There is nothing in this world that you can't do.\"  Tosca and O'Flaherty reinforced dedication in doing what you do to the best.  \"It may be after a long day, but you have to do those little things,\" O'Flaherty said, using stretching as an example. \"I hate stretching. It's the last thing I want to do, but I do it every day.\"  Tosca pointed to O'Flaherty as an example of how good things can happen if you establish a routine and stay true to it.  \"Eric's as consistent as a clock,\" Tosca said. \"You can't just take care of yourself only when you feel like it. It can't just be when it's convenient.\"  At the end of their session as each group came down from their set of stands to go to the next station, Tosca and O'Flaherty shook hands with each person and wished them good luck.   It was a little but important detail and was the kind of personal touch each player brought with him to the school.  It wasn't just the kids that benefited.   Mays' first-year baseball coach Reggie Austin, who grew up nearby and played football at Wake Forest University and for three years with the NFL's Chicago Bears before getting his teaching certification, believes the Braves opened the kids' eyes about opportunities that will serve them well and inspire them well beyond high school.  \"Especially with Don Sutton and Greg McMichael, seeing what they're doing after their playing careers are over with, both having a chance to do something still in the sport but something different,\" said Austin, who coached football the two previous years. \"Just knowing that when you do the right things now, you'll have a career after your career. If they don't take it further than high school, they'll take it on to college and get a career from that.  \"It was good to see the Braves come to our school up here on the hill at Mays High School to talk to the kids. That's huge for our kids. In our community, we need that. It's not often where you have professional players come and talk to our kids. It's just a tremendous thing for everybody.\" Jon Cooper is a contributor to MLB.com. This story was not subject to the approval of Major League Baseball or its clubs.",
