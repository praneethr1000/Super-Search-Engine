    "body": "The D-backs added a reliever Wednesday, trading for right-handed pitcher Cody Hall. Hall was designated for assignment last week by the Giants, who will receive a player to be named or cash considerations in the deal. To make room for Hall on the 40-man roster, Arizona designated right-handed pitcher Matt Stites for assignment. Hall, 28, had a 3.46 ERA in 43 games last season with Triple-A Sacramento. He made his big league debut with the Giants on Sept. 3 against the Rockies. Hall allowed six earned runs in 8 1\/3 innings over seven games. Hall's best outing came against the Rockies on Oct. 2, when he struck out three over two scoreless innings. Hall was the Giants' 19th-round pick in 2011 out of Southern University. He was added to the Giants' 40-man roster last fall and still has Minor League options. Stites, 25, had a 12.46 ERA out of the bullpen a year ago for the D-backs in 8 2\/3 innings. Stites has a 7.13 ERA in 41 2\/3 innings in the big leagues, all with the D-backs. With the Hall acquisition on Wednesday, the D-backs' 40-man roster is full. Corey Brock is a reporter for MLB.com.
