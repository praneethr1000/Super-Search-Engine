    "body": "CHICAGO -- The White Sox avoided arbitration with right-handed starter Jeff Samardzija and catcher Tyler Flowers, agreeing to terms with their final two arbitration-eligible players on Friday. Samardzija's deal is for $9.8 million, while Flowers' deal is for $2.675 million. The White Sox avoided arbitration earlier this week with outfielder Dayan Viciedo ($4.4 million), right-handed starter Hector Noesi ($1.95 million) and right-handed relievers Javy Guerra ($937,500) and Nate Jones ($660,000). Samardzija, 29, was 7-13 with a 2.99 ERA, two complete games, 202 strikeouts and a .234 opponents' average over 33 starts and 219 2\/3 innings between the Cubs and Oakland last season. The right-hander, who slots in the rotation's No. 2 spot behind Chris Sale and in front of Jose Quintana, was acquired from the A's with Michael Ynoa during this past December's Winter Meetings in exchange for right-handed pitcher Chris Bassitt, catcher Josh Phegley, first baseman Rangel Ravelo and infielder Marcus Semien. Flowers, who turns 29 during next weekend's SoxFest, ranked sixth in the Majors with 1,052 innings caught and sixth with 120 games started behind the plate. The right-handed hitter finished with a .241 average, 15 homers and 50 RBIs, with a .553 slugging percentage after the All-Star break. He threw out 30 percent of attempted basestealers, and White Sox pitchers had a 3.96 ERA with Flowers catching. He goes into the 2015 season as the club's No. 1 backstop. This was Flowers' second year of arbitration eligibility, while Samardzija can become a free agent after the 2015 campaign. The White Sox have not gone to an arbitration hearing with a player since Keith Foulke in 2001. Scott Merkin is a reporter for MLB.com.
