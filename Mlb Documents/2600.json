    "body": "SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. -- Right-hander Josh Wall and catcher Wilkin Castillo were signed to Minor League contracts on Friday by the Pirates, who also added them to the list of non-roster players invited to Spring Training. Wall, 28, re-signed with the Bucs, who had claimed him on waivers from the Angels last May after he had made a couple of appearances for Los Angeles. A former second-round Draft pick (2005, Dodgers), Wall pitched seven years in the Minors before making his big league debut in '12 with the Angels. Wall's career consists of 15 appearances in the Majors and 308 in the Minors. After he was picked up by the Pirates, Wall enjoyed arguably his finest half-season as a pro, posting a 2.91 ERA in 28 relief outings for Triple-A Indianapolis. Castillo is a 30-year-old switch-hitter who played briefly with the Reds in 2008-09, and he has since been through three other organizations' farm systems without resurfacing in the Majors. He spent the '14 season with two different teams in the Mexican League, combining to bat .206 in 33 games. Since the Mexican League is considered Triple-A caliber, last season marked Castillo's ninth at that level. The additions of Wall and Castillo bring the number of non-roster invitees to 23 for Major League camp, which officially begins on Feb. 19 with the first workout for pitchers and catchers.
