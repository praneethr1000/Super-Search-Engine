    "body": "ARLINGTON -- Catcher Luis Martinez has been claimed on waivers by the Orioles. At the same time, the Rangers announced that catcher Eli Whiteside has cleared waivers and been assigned outright to Triple-A Round Rock.  Whiteside will still be in big league camp this spring as a non-roster invitee. This marked the fourth time he was placed on waivers this offseason and the first time he cleared. He finished the season with the Giants and then was claimed off waivers in succession by the Yankees, Blue Jays and Rangers. ",
