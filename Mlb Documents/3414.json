    "body": "ATLANTA -- Eric O'Flaherty has nearly tripled his salary since producing one of the most impressive seasons ever recorded by a Major League reliever.  O'Flaherty and the Braves have avoided arbitration by agreeing to the terms of a one-year, $2.49 million contract. The 26-year-old left-handed reliever made $895,000 during his record setting 2011 season.  Proving both durable and reliable this past summer, O'Flaherty made 78 appearances and led all big league relievers with a 0.98 ERA. More impressive was the fact that he became the first reliever in Major League history to record a sub-1.00 ERA with at least 70 appearances in a season. O'Flaherty was one of the game's most underappreciated players this past summer. He was not rewarded with an All-Star selection or the postseason accolades afforded fellow Braves relievers Craig Kimbrel and Jonny Venters. But his tremendous contributions were appreciated by teammates and those who followed the club on a regular basis.   Since Peter Moylan missed most of the year while recovering from back surgery, O'Flaherty took advantage of his enhanced role and proved he could be a reliable setup man. He set career-best marks while limiting opponents to a .221 batting average and .283 on-base percentage.   This is the second of O'Flaherty's three arbitration-eligible seasons.   The Braves have avoided arbitration with O'Flaherty and Martin Prado. Their only remaining unsigned arbitration-eligible players are Michael Bourn and Jair Jurrjens.
