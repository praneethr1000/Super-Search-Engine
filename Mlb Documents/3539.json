    "body": "SAN FRANCISCO -- Gary Brown's a throwback by excelling at throwing forward. Brown possesses an excess of speed and hitting aptitude, qualities he shares with many highly regarded prospects. But his defensive skills in center field, including his throwing, separate him from the masses. That's partly why Brown was ranked 48th on MLB.com's 2012 list of the Top 100 Prospects, serving as San Francisco's highest-rated honoree. Fellow outfielder Francisco Peguero was rated 98th. This year's edition of MLB.com's Top Prospects list has expanded from 50 to 100 players. The annual ranking of baseball's biggest and brightest young talent is assembled by MLB.com's Draft and prospect expert Jonathan Mayo, who compiles input from industry sources, including scouts and scouting directors. It is based on analysis of players' skill sets, upsides, closeness to the Majors and potential immediate impact to their teams. The list, which is one of several prospect rankings on MLB.com's Prospect Watch, only includes players with rookie status in 2012. Andy Skeels, who managed Brown at Class A Advanced San Jose last year, described the 23-year-old's defense in terms that conjured memories of perhaps the greatest center fielder of all -- Giants legend Willie Mays. It was said that Mays played the outfield as if he were an infielder, hungrily pursuing balls hit in front of him, using the extent of his lateral range and always throwing aggressively.       With Brown, this talent is almost ordinary.     \"The one thing that really encouraged me, and I'm sure it encouraged a lot of other people in our organization, is to see him get challenged and get beat -- to make the adjustment coming out of that series of games that we had for about three weeks, and then to just dominate the second half the way he did,\" Skeels said.
