    "body": "More health problems for free-agent right-hander Carl Pavano could postpone his signing with a new team, as the former Twins starter ruptured his spleen while shoveling snow on his driveway and will be sidelined for six to eight weeks, according to Ken Rosenthal of FOXsports.com and MLB Network. Also per the report, Pavano's agent has declined comment. Pavano, 37, saw his 2012 season cut short due to a sore right shoulder, an injury caused by a bone bruise. He struggled in 11 starts last season, with a 6.00 ERA and 2-5 record. In his last full season, in '11, he had a 9-13 record, with career high in hits allowed (262) and a 4.30 ERA. The Rockies and Mets were among the teams that had shown interest in the starter, though New York is not expected to pursue any more starters following its signing of Shaun Marcum on Thursday. Troy Renck of the Denver Post tweeted that the Rockies \"are out\" regarding Pavano, citing an MLB source, but did not specifically say it was related to the injury.
