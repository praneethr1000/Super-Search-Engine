    "body": "NEW YORK -- The Mets have signed right-handed pitcher Buddy Carlyle to a Minor League contract with an invitation to Spring Training, the team announced Monday. Carlyle went 1-1 last season with a 1.45 ERA in 27 games, spanning three stints with the Mets. The 37-year-old ranked sixth in ERA among National League pitchers with at least 30 innings, and was unscored upon in 21 of his 27 outings. A Type 1 diabetic, Carlyle was out of professional baseball completely in 2010. He made a brief comeback with the Yankees the following season before resurfacing yet again in Flushing last summer. Over parts of eight seasons with the Padres, Dodgers, Braves, Yankees and Mets, Carlyle is 12-13 with a 5.13 ERA in 139 games. He will compete for a spot in the big league bullpen.
