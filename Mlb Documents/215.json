    "body": "Another slow day was the order of the day on the Hot Stove market Wednesday, with none of the key free agents still on the market appearing to be close to signing. Here's a rundown on what was going on around the Hot Stove front: Angels: Angels general manager Bill Stoneman described the pursuit of right-handed free agent pitcher Jeff Weaver as \"not very likely.\" He also indicated he is focusing little attention on the free agent market.    A's: Outfielder Milton Bradley and right-hander Kiko Calero agreed to one-year contracts Wednesday, avoiding arbitration.   Bradley, hoping to return to his top form after a season-ending left knee injury Aug. 23 that required surgery, will receive $3 million with the chance to earn an additional $200,000 in performance bonuses. Calero receives an $850,000 salary.   Blue Jays: Toronto signed right-hander Ben Weber to a Minor League contract. Weber was also extended an invitation to attend Spring Training in Dunedin, Fla., with the big-league club.  Weber, 36, has struggled with injuries over the last two seasons, but he was an integral part of the Angels team that won the World Series in 2002. The 6-foot-4, 205-pound reliever spent last season with Cincinnati, but was on the disabled list for most of the season with a bulging disc in his neck. Weber appeared in only 10 games for the Reds and posted an 8.03 ERA.  Weber's closest competition for a bullpen job are probably young right-handers Dustin McGowan, 23, and Brandon League, 22. Both will be trying to earn a spot with the Jays, but either could easily start with Triple-A Syracuse before being called up later. McGowan is still viewed as a future starter and League struggled in his short stint with Toronto last season.    Cardinals: The Cardinals are still looking to add a little depth on the right side of their bullpen, but nothing is imminent. Felix Rodriguez, whose name has been reported in connection with the Redbirds, holds some interest but is not particularly close to signing.    Devil Rays: Tampa Bay on Wednesday signed Japanese right-handed reliever Shinji Mori to a two-year deal believed to be worth $1.5 million with a club option for another two years for an unspecified amount.  The Rays also are interested in signing right-handed reliever Dan Miceli.     Nationals: Outfielder Marlon Byrd avoided arbitration Wednesday by agreeing to a one-year, $800,000 contract.   Padres: The Padres added lefty Shawn Estes to their rotation mix on Tuesday after agreeing to terms on a one-year contract in excess of $1 million upon completion of a physical examination by the club.  Estes, who turns 33 on Feb. 18, went 7-8 with a 4.80 ERA in 21 starts for the Arizona Diamondbacks in 2005. He was limited to 21 starts, his lowest total since 1996, after suffering a stress reaction in his left ankle July 5 at St. Louis.      Phillies: A Phillies source told MLB.com that a deal involving Bobby Abreu and Manny Ramirez is \"not happening.\"   No scenarios have been presented, even as part of a three-team blockbuster involving Miguel Tejada. This allows the Phillies to go back to figuring out ways to improve the starting rotation or bullpen, and this may involve dealing Jason Michaels.    Rangers: Right-hander Joaquin Benoit avoided arbitration by agreeing to a one-year, $775,000 contract.   Red Sox: The club is on the verge of signing quality free agent right-hander Julian Tavarez. Only the completion of a physical stands in the way of the contract being completed.   While the finalization of that contract is imminent, the Red Sox took care of another procedural matter on Wednesday, signing infielder Tony Graffanino to a one-year deal.   Graffanino was already under the contractual control of the Red Sox after accepting the club's offer of arbitration on Dec. 19. His role is uncertain at this point, but he might function as an all-purpose backup, rotating around the infield.   The deal will be for two years, with an option for a third year that would vest based on certain statistics being reached.   Tigers: The Tigers agreed to terms on a two-year contract with left-handed pitcher Mike Maroth and a one-year contract with third baseman Brandon Inge.    Jim Molony is a reporter for MLB.com.
