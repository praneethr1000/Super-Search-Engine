    "body": "Manny Ramirez is turning the heads of at least a few teams, as the outfielder looks to return to Major League Baseball. But no club is more interested in the 12-time All-Star than the A's, according to a report by ESPN.  The 39-year-old Ramirez, who retired last season after violating the league's banned substances policy for the second time, has been working out in Miami and plans to have open workout sessions for interested teams later this month.  The Orioles and Blue Jays already have watched Ramirez hit, according to the report, but a source told ESPN that Oakland is \"very interested\" in Ramirez. \"The Orioles and Blue Jays saw Manny work and Baltimore liked what it saw, but Oakland has been the team that has expressed the most interest, even before having him work out,\" the source told ESPN.   Ramirez, a 19-year veteran, has hit .312 with 555 home runs during his career with the Indians, Red Sox, Dodgers, White Sox and Rays.   If Ramirez were to sign with a team, he would serve a 50-game suspension stemming from his positive test last season. Ramirez and MLB had previously agreed on lowering the suspension from 100 games, which is the typical punishment for a second positive test.  Cash Kruth is a reporter for MLB.com.
