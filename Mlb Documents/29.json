    "body": "Spring Training, as we all happily understand, is a time when the game begins anew, and life in general looks a little more promising.  But this spring, there will be two baseball beginnings. As a result, the overall Spring Training scene will be a little less pastoral and a lot more competitive.  For the vast majority of players, the drill will not be changed. The rookies and the fringe guys will once again be competing for opportunities, for jobs, for livelihoods. The veteran players on guaranteed contracts will once again be tuning up, trying to find the balance between not peaking too early and being absolutely ready for the start of the real thing in April. This will once again be good stuff, a time of optimism and promise, whether you are seeing orange groves in Florida or cacti in Arizona. But there will a parallel Spring Training universe this March, with the advent of the first World Baseball Classic. All the way from Japan to Puerto Rico, 16 baseball-playing nations will be competing in baseball's own version of the World Cup.   How this will work, how compelling the competition will be, how it will be received by the baseball public, at home and abroad, are all matters of conjecture, albeit sincere conjecture, now. What is for certain is that many of the game's biggest names will not be quietly preparing their individual games on out-of-the-way practice fields. Instead, they will be competing for their countries in what baseball hopes will be an extremely high-profile event.   This is good, too. In this winter of 2006, what would normally be the single international sporting event whose coverage would dominate both the airwaves and the print media? Olympic figure skating. I don't believe that the anticipation of the World Baseball Classic will diminish the coverage of the long program. But it will give us another major international sporting event in which you can determine the winner objectively, by looking at the scoreboard, rather than by attempting to figure out who has been whispering in the ear of the French judge.   For baseball fans, the WBC offers a new set of spring questions to be answered. The usual questions will still be there for the individual clubs: Can we find some more bullpen depth? Can we get a little more left-handed pop in this lineup? Do we have a real fifth starter or are we just kidding ourselves?   But now, there will be a new set of questions: Could the Dominican Republic beat the U.S. and win this thing? What about that Cuban team? Andruw Jones isn't actually Dutch, is he? And, of course, will anybody get seriously injured?   That last question is the storm cloud hanging over this particular picnic. A big star could just as easily be hurt under more normal Spring Training circumstances. A big star could get hurt in an exhibition game against the Kansas City Royals. A big star could get hurt in a base-running drill on Field 5. A big star could get hurt during morning calisthenics. But if a big star gets hurt in the World Baseball Classic, there will be a widespread, hand-wringing, I-told-you-so reaction.   The WBC will dramatically alter the basic Spring Training dynamic for the stars of the game who participate. March is typically a time to get ready, with the exhibition games being just one part of the equation. Now, March will be a time to defend national honor on the diamond. It's a long way from low pressure and little scrutiny to being ready to perform at something resembling your absolute best, right now, in a high-visibility venue. All sorts of limits have been set to lessen the possibility of fatigue-induced injuries. There is sort of a contest within a contest, finding out not only which nation triumphs, but how to balance the long-term physical welfare of the contestants with the natural desire to go out there and give it your all for the good old USA, or Venezuela, or, one supposes, South Africa.   We all anticipate seeing how this will play out. It's new, it's star-studded, it's overdue recognition that the game is broader and wider and more of a multicultural undertaking than it ever was. But we also don't forget the basics that will still be in place, not widely publicized, not even seen by many, but still the essence of baseball as winter turns toward spring. Pitchers and catchers must report first. No renewal begins until, in 30 spring camps, the pitcher takes the mound and the catcher assumes his crouch. Everything seems to change this spring, but then again, it all remains the same. Mike Bauman is a national columnist for MLB.com.
