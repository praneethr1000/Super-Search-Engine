    "body": "The Red Sox and Nationals traded Minor League players on Tuesday, with Boston sending catcher Dan Butler to Washington in exchange for left-hander Danny Rosenbaum. Nationals general manager and president of baseball operations Mike Rizzo made the announcement. Butler, 28, spent the majority of the 2014 season with Triple-A Pawtucket and hit .241. He also had limited action with the Red Sox, appearing in seven games. Butler was recently designated for assignment to make room on the 40-man roster for Craig Breslow. Rosenbaum, 27, spent all of last season with Triple-A Syracuse. He was limited to four starts, going 1-1 with a 4.50 ERA over 20 innings. In 28 starts with Syracuse in 2013, the southpaw was 7-11 with a 3.87 ERA. Austin Laymance is a reporter for MLB.com.
