    "body": "CINCINNATI -- The Reds claimed an outfielder on Friday and announced more Spring Training invites.  Outfielder Jeff Fiorentino was picked up off waivers from the Orioles, which brought the Reds' 40-man roster to 39 players. Fiorentino batted .282 with 15 home runs, 65 RBIs, a .346 on-base percentage and a .445 slugging percentage in 2007 for Double-A Bowie.  A former third-round Draft pick, Fiorentino was designated for assignment by Baltimore on Wednesday. Considered a good defensive player with speed, he has 32 games of Major League experience in 2005-06 and batted .253 (21-for-83) with one homer and 12 RBIs. Mark Sheldon is a reporter for MLB.com.
