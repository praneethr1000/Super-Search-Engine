    "body": "KANSAS CITY -- Pitcher Jacob Rodriguez, who has yet to pitch in a Minor League game for the Royals, has been suspended by the Commissioner's Office.  Rodriguez, a 19-year-old right-hander, received a 50-game suspension on Thursday for failure to take a drug test, a violation of the Minor League Drug Prevention and Treatment Program.  Rodriguez, from Whittier, Calif., was drafted in the 22nd round of the 2007 First-Year Player Draft by the Royals. He signed too late in the summer to play with the Surprise Royals in the Arizona Rookie League, but he had worked out in Arizona. J.J. Picollo, the Royals' director of player development, said Rodriguez was summoned for random testing this winter and reported as requested but had to leave before completing the required test.   \"It's an unfortunate situation,\" Picollo said. \"It's not a case where he tested positive. ... It's basically getting suspended for not being compliant.\"   Picollo said Rodriguez has a power arm with a fastball in the 94-95 mph range. Dick Kaegel is a reporter for MLB.com.
