    "subtitle": "",
    "body": "The Rangers have added a veteran to their mix of potential bench players for 2013. Jeff Baker, 31 and heading into his ninth Major League season, signed a Minor League deal with Texas that includes an invite to big league camp. Baker had a busy 2012 between three teams: the Cubs, Tigers and Braves. Usable at first, second, third and in the outfield, Baker hit .239 with four home runs and a .279 on-base percentage in 83 games. He's spent nearly his whole career in the National League, with just 15 games played for the American League -- all in Detroit last year. Baker's competition in Spring Training figures to include Leury Garcia, Yangervis Solarte and Brandon Snyder. A right-handed hitter, Baker has been particularly good against southpaws, with a .296\/.344\/.498 career line against them. Baker's career-high for home runs was 12 in 2008, and he's a lifetime .266 hitter with five career pinch-hit homers. The Rangers on Saturday also made official the signing of left-hander Nate Robertson to a Minor League deal with a big league invite. The 35-year-old hasn't been in the Majors since 2010.
