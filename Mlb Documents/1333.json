Putz, keeping the closer in Arizona through the 2014 season.  \"J.J. has provided much-needed leadership and stability for our bullpen the last two years,\" general manager Kevin Towers said on Monday. \"He has been an integral piece and helped set the foundation for our bullpen's turnaround, so we are excited to have him in place the next two seasons.\"  \"I'm very happy to be a member of the great D-backs organization and family though 2014,\" said Putz. \"It's special to be with my family year-round, so we're all really excited.\" Gary Cotton is a reporter for MLB.com.
