    "body": "WASHINGTON -- Bob Carpenter will return to the Mid-Atlantic Sports Network as the play-by-play voice of the Nationals, according a baseball source. Late last year, it appeared Carpenter would not return to the booth after the Nats didn't pick up his option last August, but both sides managed to come to terms recently. Calls to Carpenter were not returned. It will mark Carpenter's seventh season in the broadcast booth for MASN. He is known for the catch phrase, \"See you later,\" whenever a Nationals player hits a home run. F.P. Santangelo will continue to be Carpenter's broadcast partner. Santangelo is the fifth TV partner for Carpenter, who has worked with Tom Paciorek, Don Sutton, Rob Dibble and Ray Knight. Bill Ladson is a reporter for MLB.com and writes an MLBlog, All Nats All the time. He also could be found on Twitter @WashingNats.
