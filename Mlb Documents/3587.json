    "body": "ARLINGTON -- Yu Darvish's goal is to be the best pitcher in the world. According to news reports out of Japan, he told the Japanese media that's why he asked the Hokkaido Nippon Ham Fighters to be posted in December so he could pitch in the Major Leagues.  The Rangers won the rights to negotiate with Darvish on Dec. 18. They bid $51.7 million and signed him to a six-year, $60 million contract last week.  \"I want to become the kind of pitcher that will make people say, 'Darvish is the No. 1 pitcher in the world,'\" Darvish said at a news conference on Tuesday.
