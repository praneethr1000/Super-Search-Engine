    "body": "LOS ANGELES -- The Dodgers rounded out their bullpen Thursday by re-signing free-agent right-hander Mike MacDougal to a one-year deal for $1 million, with a 2013 option.  MacDougal, who turns 35 in March, was signed a year ago by the Dodgers to a $500,000 Minor League deal and was the bargain of the year.  After battling through injuries and a Minor League demotion by the Cardinals in 2010, the former closer with Kansas City and Washington filled a key middle relief role for the Dodgers with 69 appearances and a 2.05 ERA (1.78 against division opponents). He had two 11-game scoreless streaks and limited hitters to a .157 average with runners in scoring position. MacDougal provides right-handed veteran depth behind young closers Javy Guerra and Kenley Jansen. Other right-handers expected to be in the bullpen are Matt Guerrier, Josh Lindblom and Blake Hawksworth.  Scott Elbert advances to the primary left-hander spot with the non-tendering of Hong-Chih Kuo, who had his fifth elbow operation and was hampered last year by anxiety disorder. That's a complete turnaround from a year ago, when the Dodgers were looking for lefties to replace Elbert, who went home in the middle of the 2010 season with stress-related issues.  Competition for a second lefty spot will include at least two left-handed non-roster invitees with past Major League experience -- Wil Ledezma and Alberto Castillo -- along with Michael Antonini, who was recently promoted to the 40-man roster.
