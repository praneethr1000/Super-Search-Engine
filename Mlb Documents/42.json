    "body": "PITTSBURGH -- The Pittsburgh Pirates checked off the final item of their Hot Stove wish list Wednesday by inking free agent outfielder Jeromy Burnitz to a one-year, $6 million deal with a mutual option for the 2007 season.  Burnitz, who will turn 37 a few weeks after Opening Day, fills the Bucs' need for a left-handed power hitter in the middle of their batting order. In 13 big league seasons, Burnitz has a .255 career batting average with 299 home runs and 932 RBIs. He has topped the 30 home run plateau six times and the 100 RBI mark on four different occasions.  In 2005, Burnitz batted .258 with 31 doubles, 24 home runs and 87 RBIs and a .757 OPS in 160 games with the Chicago Cubs. The addition of Burnitz will push Craig Wilson to the bench. This has led to speculation that Wilson's days with the Pirates could be numbered because he will receive a raise from the $3 million he earned last season.       Ed Eagle is a reporter for MLB.com.
