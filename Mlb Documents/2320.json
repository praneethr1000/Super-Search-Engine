    "body": "LEDYARD, Conn. -- Count Red Sox principal owner John Henry among the prominent Bostonians in favor of bringing the 2024 Olympics to the Hub. Henry, speaking at Foxwoods as the club kicked off its \"Winter Weekend,\" said he isn't formally involved with the \"Boston 2024\" campaign, but he supports what the organization is trying to do. \"I think it would be great,\" Henry said. \"We're going to try to do everything we can to help be a part of making it happen.\" Should Boston indeed be selected as the host city -- a decision that is still more than two years away -- it could affect the Sox in a couple of ways. One is logistics. The team would likely need to take a lengthy road trip while the Summer Games are underway, similar to the Braves embarking on a 17-game swing when Atlanta hosted in 1996. \"It's not a sacrifice I would make,\" Henry said. \"It's a question of whether or not baseball would agree to it, the players' union would agree to it, our players would agree to it.\" The other aspect is whether Fenway Park itself would be involved. According to Henry, no one from Boston 2024 has approached him about it, but he's certainly open to the idea. Though baseball isn't an Olympic sport, the possibility exists that it could be reinstated by 2024. \"We'll certainly be listening,\" Henry said. Tim Healey is a contributor to MLB.com.
