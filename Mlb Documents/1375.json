    "body": "CHICAGO -- Cubs pitchers Matt Garza, Jeff Samardzija and James Russell were among the 133 Major League players who filed for salary arbitration on Tuesday.  This is the first year Samardzija and Russell are arbitration eligible, while Garza is in his final year of arbitration and will be a free agent after this season.  The three players and the Cubs will exchange salary figures on Friday. If the two sides cannot reach an agreement, there will be a hearing sometime between Feb. 1-21 in front of an independent arbitrator. Garza avoided arbitration last year, signing a one-year, $9.5 million contract with the Cubs. There had been some discussion regarding a long-term deal for the right-hander. He was limited to 18 starts because of a right elbow injury, which forced him to shut down after July 21.   Samardzija, who was 9-13 with a 3.81 ERA in his first full season as a starter, made $2.64 million last season, while Russell, who appeared in a career-high 77 games, made $512,500.
