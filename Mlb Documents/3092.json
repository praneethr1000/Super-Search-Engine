    "body": "ARLINGTON -- The Rangers are one of several teams that have expressed interest in free-agent first baseman\/outfielder Brad Hawpe, according to industry sources.  Hawpe, who is from the Fort Worth area, is of interest to the Rangers as possible insurance at first base in case Mitch Moreland has trouble coming back from wrist surgery. Moreland had surgery on his right wrist in November and is not expected to be at full strength by the beginning of Spring Training.  The Rangers expect Moreland to be ready by Opening Day and they still expect him to be their regular first baseman. But the Rangers want to make sure their depth is covered in case Moreland is delayed. T.R. Sullivan is a reporter for MLB.com.
