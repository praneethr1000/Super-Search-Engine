    "body": "LOS ANGELES -- First pitch is scheduled for 1 a.m. PT, but when the Dodgers open the season in Australia on March 22, Vin Scully will be there broadcasting. Scully and the team confirmed he will make the 17-hour team flight and call the play-by-play for the Dodgers' new SportsNet LA regional network. In recent years, Scully, 86, has limited his coverage of Dodgers road games to California and Arizona. \"We're thrilled that he'll be there,\" said Lon Rosen, Dodgers executive vice president and chief marketing officer. Scully, embarking on his 65th season calling Dodgers games, said the club asked him to go because the two-game set against the D-backs at the legendary Sydney Cricket Grounds also kicks off regular-season coverage by the club's new network. The March 23 game in Australia will start at 7 p.m. (PT). After the games in Australia, the team returns for two Freeway Series games against the Angels, which Scully also will call, before resuming the regular season in San Diego on March 30, a game that will be televised by ESPN. The first road trip that Scully will miss will be at the end of April, when the Dodgers travel to Minnesota, Miami and Washington. That will mark the regular-season debut of the new TV broadcasting alignment, with Charley Steiner joined by Orel Hershiser. Ken Gurnick is a reporter for MLB.com.
