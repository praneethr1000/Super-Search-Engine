    "body": "When the Astros approached him about their general manager vacancy, Jeff Luhnow started to type out all the ideas that had been percolating in his mind over the course of eight years in the baseball business with the St. Louis Cardinals. He took an honest look at the Astros -- an intradivision team he knew intimately -- and articulated all his beliefs about the acquisition and development of talent and how decisions ought to be made at the big league level. A couple days and 40 pages later, he was finished. Anthony Castrovince is a reporter for MLB.com. Read his columns and his blog, CastroTurf, and follow him on Twitter at @Castrovince.
