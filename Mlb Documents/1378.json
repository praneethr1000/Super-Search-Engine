    "body": "LOS ANGELES -- Starting catcher A.J. Ellis and reliever Ronald Belisario are the two Dodgers that filed for salary arbitration on Tuesday, both earning the right as \"Super Twos.\"  Ellis, 31, is coming off his first year as a regular, having hit .270 with 13 homers and 52 RBIs and throwing out 36 potential basestealers, second in the league. His 131 games caught were third in the league, as were his 11 passed balls. He made $490,000 last year.  Belisario, 30, is coming off a remarkable comeback season after missing the entire 2011 season after testing positive for cocaine. He went 8-1 with a 2.54 ERA, despite serving a 25-game suspension at the start of the season for the failed test and rebounding from a very shaky July. He received $480,000 last year. Super Twos qualify for arbitration with at least two years and 139 days of Major League service. Both players have two years and 151 days of service. Ken Gurnick is a reporter for MLB.com.
