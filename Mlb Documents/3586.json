    "body": "SAN FRANCISCO -- Tim Lincecum ended his final foray into salary arbitration Tuesday by agreeing to a two-year, $40.5 million deal that could propel the right-hander into the open market -- but not necessarily away from the Giants. The contract's expiration coincides with Lincecum's potential entry into free agency, which might be widely interpreted as a barely concealed farewell to San Francisco. But industry sources said that the contract includes a limited no-trade clause, reflecting Lincecum's desire to remain a Giant. Lincecum also committed to purchase 25 tickets to each home game at AT&T Park for underprivileged children. Chris Haft is a reporter for MLB.com.
