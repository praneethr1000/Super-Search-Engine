    "body": "SAN FRANCISCO -- Continuing to ease the salary arbitration burden that looms ahead of them, the Giants agreed to terms with outfielder Angel Pagan on a one-year, $4.85 million contract Monday. Pagan's accord trimmed San Francisco's list of potential arbitration cases to six: Right-handers Tim Lincecum, Santiago Casilla and Sergio Romo; outfielders Melky Cabrera and Nate Schierholtz; and third baseman Pablo Sandoval. Though that ranks among the largest such contingents the Giants ever have confronted, it's a fraction of what they potentially faced as the offseason began, when they had 13 arbitration-eligibles. The Giants still must grapple with what could be among the most challenging arbitration cases in history. When teams exchange proposals for one-year contracts with arbitration-eligible performers on Wednesday, one of the most-watched sets of figures will be those involving Lincecum, the two-time National League Cy Young Award winner who could approach or exceed $20 million annually.
