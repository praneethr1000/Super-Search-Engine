    "body": "The Cincinnati Reds' annual winter caravan visited a variety of locales in Ohio, Indiana, Kentucky and West Virginia over the past few days (including, most notably, Athens, Ohio -- or, as my fellow Ohio University graduates might refer to it, the Navel of the Universe and the Land of Milk and Honey). While the point of these caravans is always to generate interest in the season ahead, the Reds seemed to make attendance a particularly pointed issue in 2011.
