    "body": "ARLINGTON -- Matt Harrison is getting at least one reward for his outstanding 2012 season. He will be honored on Friday night as the Rangers Pitcher of the Year at the club's annual awards show at the Arlington Convention Center.  \"It's very humbling for many reasons,\" Harrison said. \"Being where I was a few years ago, not knowing if I had a place on the team, struggling with adversity, reading negative things about you. But it made me a stronger person and more motivated.\"  The awards will begin at 8 p.m. on Friday at the Convention Center. But Pitcher of the Year is just the first reward that Harrison may receive this offseason. A multiyear contract might also be in the works. T.R. Sullivan is a reporter for MLB.com.
