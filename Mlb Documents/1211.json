    "body": "KANSAS CITY -- Earl Weaver, the Orioles' Hall of Fame manager who died on Saturday, was notorious for his run-ins with umpires.  \"He was tough with umpires, but he was a very good manager,\" one of his umpire adversaries, Steve Palermo, said. \"A little pun intended -- you had to give the devil his due. He was a very good manager. But you were always on red alert with him because you never knew what he was going to do next. He was very unconventional.\"  Palermo, now a supervisor of Major League umpires, remembered a late-season game between the Orioles and Yankees in a pennant race.
